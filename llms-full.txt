Hello, I'm John, and I'm a Research/engineer, technical leader, and entrepreneur working at the intersection of blockchain infrastructure (Solving, Market Making, Arbitrage) and Decentralized protocols (Intents, Liquidity Management, Settlement). I have a track record of driving projects from conception to completion, identifying research gaps, and providing solutions. Finally, I love leading engineering teams and have the ability to drive collaboration across the organization and the entire ecosystem.

I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes. [Here](https://www.jincubator.com/research/intro) you'll find an overview of my work in 2025 on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing, an opinionated architecture is [here](https://www.jincubator.com/research/solving/architecture). It uses [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview).

As of July 2025 I'm currently wanting to collaborate with thought leaders in this space. Specifically I'm interested in

* Grants and Bounties: Including Deliverable based grants around solving, routing, liquidity management
* Consulting Work: I'm interested in work primarily Smart Contract work and RUST Development in the Solving and Intent based space
* Full Time Roles: I'd enjoy working with a team in this space. TBD whether that will be launching the protocol I've been working with as part of a founding team or with a more established organization building out innovative frameworks in the space. I'm happy working as an individual contributor or leading engineering teams, as have done so for a large part of my career. Historically I've worked with Early Stage Startups 10-30 team members but am comfortable with both smaller and larger teams.

Below is a quick professional summary, more detail can be found on [the resume page](https://johnwhitton.com/resume/intro)

I worked as a Senior Protocol Engineer, previously Engineering Manager at [Eco](https://eco.com) building a payment focused intent protocol on a dedicated L3 rollup. Read the docs [here](https://docs.eco.com/) and the code [here](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes).

I have researched zero knowledge proofs, cryptographic primitives and consensus protocols.

I consulted as a research engineer providing strategy, research, design and building out DeFi infrastructure including trustless bridging, web3 identity and wallets. Deployments have been on EVM compatible chains including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).

I prototyped the DEX [Kanga Finance](https://github.com/kangafinance) (inspired by [Sushi](https://github.com/sushiswap)) and a DeFi parachain [eave.network](https://github.com/eavenetwork) (inspired by [Acala](https://github.com/acalanetwork)). Deployments on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/). As founder for these projects, I was responsible for writing whitepapers, reviewing legal infrastructure, and fundraising. Although projects had investor interest and were awarded [hackathon prizes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZGrbKSaAdtzvMzVh0EVFBfUvA4SqiAeYVXGhJN7Orbs/edit#slide=id.g48989ac23a_0_0) the projects did not move forward due to a combination of team commitment, market fit and crypto market conditions.

Previously I was as an Ecosystem Architect at Harmony. Where I helped launch the Harmony Mainnet, grew the ecosystem and was also intimately involved with hiring decisions and business strategy. Prior to this I was CTO for Loyyal (BaaS company) where we built private permissioned blockchains on Ethereum and Hypersphere Fabric and I managed a team of seven engineers.

I have worked extensively with decentralized financial protocols, bringing a unique perspective by combining my extensive corporate experience with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and KPMG with the disruptive financial models being developed on blockchain.

My earlier career focused on enterprise applications, service oriented architectures and cross application business processes. Where I founded a consultancy firm which grew to $800k in revenues and ran from 2000-2009. One of my former clients, EFI ($1.6 billion market cap) brought me on as a Manager in Enterprise Systems Architecture where I remained for 6 years.

I have been passionate about software and technology since high school. I graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science before travelling globally leading the design and development of many Service Oriented Architectures and Blockchain implementations.

#### [Andy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-wu-4329664/)

John is one of the most professional engineers I’ve ever worked with. He takes the ownership of many OPS works,
and documents them down with meticulous details. Also, he is a fast learner, and eager to pick up new skills. He also has very good project management skills, and I believe he could be a very good leader either in biz or eng departments.


#### [Ganesha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gupadhyaya/)

John is dedicated, hard-working, great work ethics, and brings lot of positive energy. no doubt that he is a great manager with good people skills. john led the whole hiring process and single handedly managed it well, without much chaos. no joke how much time and energy it takes. great job. while i believe it was not the best use of john's time, he embraced whatever this staking launch demanded from him. great work towards managing the release (deployment, documentation, etc) and taking some load of andy and daniel. after the staking release, john could refocus and quickly get back to speed on the ecosystem/tooling/partner tasks/goals for q4 and expedite some of the deliverables.

## John's Colleagues

<ZoomImage src="/images/HarmonyTeam.jpg" alt="Harmony Team" title="HarmonyTeam" />

I have been fortunate over my long career to have the opportunity to work with some of the most talented individuals and teams not only in Silicon Valley, but globally.

In my role as a founder, cto, ecoystem architect and engineer. I have learned from great leaders,
researchers, business strategists and engineers. I have built great teams and mentored many talented junior engineers. I have watched my teams apply their solid technical foundation to become invaluable contributors to the team and the organization. Watching individuals grow both personally and professionally is the most rewarding work I have done.

Here is a video highlighting the strengths of the Harmony Team that I was fortunate enough to work with.

  Here are some quotes from some of the greatest people you'll ever get to work
  with
</a>


#### [Janet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janet-liang-754090135/)

John is always willing to work on whatever the team needs even though you don't necessarily want to.
thank you for listening and being a great mentor.


#### [Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lijiang2087/)

I want to thank John for having a detailed process and documentation of the OSTN network upgrades and resets and communicating to me and community.


#### [Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattlockyer/)

John is amazing at explaining and delegating. I’m always impressed with his knowledge base. I think more efforts could be made to capture his knowledge in “explainers”, that would go a long way to supporting the community. John can also run anything, like up and running in a matter of minutes. This means he can troubleshoot tons of deployment issues from the core protocol all the way up to the application layer


#### [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickwh8te/)

John is always willing to jump on whatever needs to get done. he jumped SDK to hiring and then back into network ops. I think that John does a good job of recruiting and onboarding new interns and giving them appropriate difficulty tasks as they ramp up. I'm grateful that he stepped in to cover miami devcon for me at the last minute. team player


#### [Olivier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierveyrac/)

John and I worked together at Autodesk during the implementation of the subscription program, John was a lead SAP developer working on the program. I frequently interacted with him as we rolled out the program. John has the rare gift of being able to understand complex business problems and map them to a technical solution. His drive and passion for the project, combined with his excellent communication skills and deep technical knowledge, were key factors in the successful rollout of the program. We've since become close friends. I'd recommend anyone looking for a technical lead with business acumen to consider John.


#### [Yishuang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenyishuang/)

John is a really good team player, among his good qualities, I admire three most.

1. Helpful and warm-hearted whenever you ask for help, John will give you the best help.
2. Avid learner, John likes to learn new things and will actively take new tasks. I see John actively in ops recently.
3. Responsible, longer view, John focused a lot on knowledge transfer. He wants to make sure the knowledge can be shared with the whole team and future new employees, so he contributed a lot on internal wiki gitbooks, which I think it’s a good point.
