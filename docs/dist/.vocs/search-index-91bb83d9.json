And in this context, &quot;Ethereum&quot; refers not just to the base chain, but also any proper L2 that is built on it. If Ethereum gets 51% attacked and reverts, Arbitrum and Optimism revert too, and so &quot;cross-rollup&quot; applications that hold state on Arbitrum and Optimism are guaranteed to remain consistent even if Ethereum gets 51% attacked.

If a rollup stores its data on Celestia or BCH or whatever else but deals with assets on Ethereum, if that layer gets 51% attacked you&#x27;re screwed.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The attestation contains the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)</li>\n<li>data: details relating to the attestation, as defined below</li>\n<li>signature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slot: The slot number that the attestation refers to</li>\n<li>index: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot</li>\n<li>beacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)</li>\n<li>source: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block</li>\n<li>target: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.</p>\n<p>Finally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p>Following is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.\nThe attestation contains the following components:\n\naggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)\ndata: details relating to the attestation, as defined below\nsignature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators\n\nThe first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:\n\nslot: The slot number that the attestation refers to\nindex: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot\nbeacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)\nsource: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block\ntarget: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch\n\nOnce the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.\nFinally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.\n\nTechnical Details\nFollowing is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations. For data structures, please see Beacon State Data Structures from Prysm and web3signer_types from prysm.\nBeaconState contains both a ReadOnlyBeaconState and a WriteOnlyBeaconState wich contain ReadOnlyValidators and ReadOnlyRandaoMixes and WriteOnlyValidators and WriteOnlyRandaoMixes respectively.\nAt the beginning of each epoch func ProcessRandaoMixesReset processes the final updates to RANDAO mix during epoch processing. This calls RandaoMix which returns the randao mix (xor&#x27;ed seed) of a given slot. It is used to shuffle validators.\nFollowing are sample mixes generated from func TestRandaoMix_OK by adding the statement fmt.Printf(&quot;mix: %v\\n&quot;, mix)\nmix: [10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [40 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [159 134 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nThe shuffle functions consist of\n\n\nfunc ShuffleList: returns list of shuffled indexes in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\nFollowing is an example of a shuffled list generated from TestShuffleList_OK\nlist1: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\nseed1: [1 128 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nshuffledList1: [0 7 8 6 3 9 4 5 2 1]\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndex: returns p(index) in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndices: ShuffledIndices uses input beacon state and returns the shuffled indices of the input epoch, the shuffled indices then can be used to break up into committees.\n\n\nCommittes are formed using functions from beacon_comittee.go\n\n\nfunc BeaconComittee: returns the beacon committee of a given slot and committee index. The validator indices and seed are provided as an argument rather than an imported implementation from the spec definition. Having them as an argument allows for cheaper computation run time. (This is an optomized version of func BeaconComitteFromState)\nFollowing is an example of a beaconComittee generated by adding the following lines to TestBeaconCommitteeFromState_UpdateCacheForPreviousEpoch:\nvar beaconCommittee []types.ValidatorIndex\nbeaconCommittee, err = BeaconCommitteeFromState(context.Background(), state, 1 /_previous

It determines the security and performance of a blockchain and is often referred to as the &quot;engine&quot; of a blockchain. Harmony’s consensus algorithm is called Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT), which is an innovative upgrade on the famous PBFT algorithm. FBFT is one order of magnitude faster and more scalable than PBFT because BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) aggregate signature is used to significantly reduce the communication cost. Specifically, FBFT allows at least 250 validators to reach consensus within 2 seconds.</p>\n<p>For every round of consensus in FBFT, one validator serves as the “leader” and there are three phases: the announce phase, the prepare phase and the commit phase. In the announce phase, the leader proposes a new block and broadcasts the block hash to all of the validators. In the prepare phase, validators verify the message and sign on the block hash, as well as sending the signature back to the leader. The prepare phase finishes when signatures with more than 2/3 of the voting power are collected. After that, the leader aggregated the collected signatures into a O(1)-sized BLS aggregate signature and then broadcast it with the whole block to start the commit phase. The commit phase involves validators verifying the block and doing a similar signing process as the prepare phase (i.e. 2/3 voting power collection). The consensus is reached after the commit phase is done. This whole process can be done within 2 seconds in mainnet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following is an excerpt from <a href=\"https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/definitions/epoch-transition\">Epoch Transition</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An epoch is a period of time when the beacon shard (i.e. shard 0, the coordinator for other shards) produces a fixed number of blocks. In Harmony mainnet, an epoch is 32768 blocks (~18.2h with a 2s block time) in the beacon shard</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: If the leader fails to produce a block within a certain time frame, then a new leader is elected</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets//research/harmony-consensus.png\" alt=\"Harmony FBFT\" title=\"Harmony FBFT\"/></p>\n<p>Block Structure from <a href=\"https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/blob/main/block/v3/header.go\">harmony</a></p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">type headerFields struct {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> ParentHash          common.Hash    </span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">`json:&quot;parentHash&quot;

It determines the security and performance of a blockchain and is often referred to as the &quot;engine&quot; of a blockchain. Harmony’s consensus algorithm is called Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT), which is an innovative upgrade on the famous PBFT algorithm. FBFT is one order of magnitude faster and more scalable than PBFT because BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) aggregate signature is used to significantly reduce the communication cost. Specifically, FBFT allows at least 250 validators to reach consensus within 2 seconds.\nFor every round of consensus in FBFT, one validator serves as the “leader” and there are three phases: the announce phase, the prepare phase and the commit phase. In the announce phase, the leader proposes a new block and broadcasts the block hash to all of the validators. In the prepare phase, validators verify the message and sign on the block hash, as well as sending the signature back to the leader. The prepare phase finishes when signatures with more than 2/3 of the voting power are collected. After that, the leader aggregated the collected signatures into a O(1)-sized BLS aggregate signature and then broadcast it with the whole block to start the commit phase. The commit phase involves validators verifying the block and doing a similar signing process as the prepare phase (i.e. 2/3 voting power collection). The consensus is reached after the commit phase is done. This whole process can be done within 2 seconds in mainnet.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from Epoch Transition\n\nAn epoch is a period of time when the beacon shard (i.e. shard 0, the coordinator for other shards) produces a fixed number of blocks. In Harmony mainnet, an epoch is 32768 blocks (~18.2h with a 2s block time) in the beacon shard\n\nNote: If the leader fails to produce a block within a certain time frame, then a new leader is elected\n\nBlock Structure from harmony\ntype headerFields struct {\n ParentHash          common.Hash    `json:&quot;parentHash&quot;       gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Coinbase            common.Address `json:&quot;miner&quot;            gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Root                common.Hash    `json:&quot;stateRoot&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n TxHash              common.Hash    `json:&quot;transactionsRoot&quot; gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n ReceiptHash         common.Hash    `json:&quot;receiptsRoot&quot;     gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n OutgoingReceiptHash common.Hash    `json:&quot;outgoingReceiptsRoot&quot;     gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n IncomingReceiptHash common.Hash    `json:&quot;incomingReceiptsRoot&quot; gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Bloom               ethtypes.Bloom `json:&quot;logsBloom&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Number              *big.Int       `json:&quot;number&quot;           gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n GasLimit            uint64         `json:&quot;gasLimit&quot;         gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n GasUsed             uint64         `json:&quot;gasUsed&quot;          gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Time                *big.Int       `json:&quot;timestamp&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Extra               []byte         `json:&quot;extraData&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n MixDigest           common.Hash    `json:&quot;mixHash&quot;          gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n // Additional Fields\n ViewID              *big.Int `json:&quot;viewID&quot;           gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Epoch               *big.Int `json:&quot;epoch&quot;            gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n ShardID             uint32   `json:&quot;shardID&quot;          gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n LastCommitSignature [96]byte `json:&quot;lastCommitSignature&quot;  gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n LastCommitBitmap    []byte   `json:&quot;lastCommitBitmap&quot;     gencodec:&quot;required&quot;` // Contains which validator signed\n Vrf                 []byte   `json:&quot;vrf&quot;`\n Vdf                 []byte   `json:&quot;vdf&quot;`\n ShardState          []byte   `json:&quot;shardState&quot;`\n CrossLinks          []byte   `json:&quot;crossLink&quot;`\n Slashes             []byte   `json:&quot;slashes&quot;`\n}\n","title":"Harmony Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT)","titles":["Harmony","Consensus Mechanism"]},"273":{"href":"/research/chains/harmony#signing-mechanism","html":"\n<p>Harmony uses BLS12_381 signatures for validators signing blocks.

At a high level the light client needs to fetch at least one block per <a href=\"https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/epoch\">epoch</a> i.e. every 42,200 blocks or approxmiately 12 hours. Also Having the LightClientBlockView for block $B$ is sufficient to be able to verify any statement about state or outcomes in any block in the ancestry of $B$ (including $B$ itself).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it. Specifically, it either returns the last final block of the next epoch, or the last final known block.

Then anyone can challenge a signature in a submitted header within a 4-hour challenge window. The challenge requires verification of a single Ed25519 signature which would cost about 500k Ethereum gas (expensive, but possible). The user submitting the NEAR header would have to post a bond in Ethereum tokens, and a successful challenge would burn half of the bond and return the other half to the challenger. The bond should be large enough to pay for the gas even if the gas price increases exponentially during the 4 hours. For instance, a 20 ETH bond would cover gas price hikes up to 20000 Gwei. This optimistic approach requires having a watchdog service that monitors submitted NEAR headers and challenges any headers with invalid signatures. For added security, independent users can run several watchdog services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nNEAR Light Client Documentation gives an overview of how light clients work. At a high level the light client needs to fetch at least one block per epoch i.e. every 42,200 blocks or approxmiately 12 hours. Also Having the LightClientBlockView for block $B$ is sufficient to be able to verify any statement about state or outcomes in any block in the ancestry of $B$ (including $B$ itself).\n\nThe RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it. Specifically, it either returns the last final block of the next epoch, or the last final known block. If there&#x27;s no newer final block than the one the light client knows about, the RPC returns an empty result.\nA standalone light client would bootstrap by requesting next blocks until it receives an empty result, and then periodically request the next light client block.\nA smart contract-based light client that enables a bridge to NEAR on a different blockchain naturally cannot request blocks itself.

A portal-network DHT is different than a traditional one in that each participant could selectively limit its workload by choosing a small interest radius r. A participants only process messages that are within its chosen radius boundary.\n\n\nWire Protocol: For a subprotocol, we need to further define the following to be able to instantiate the wire format of each message type. 1. content_key 2. content_id 3. payload\nThe content of the message is a Merkle proof contains multiple leave nodes for a BeaconState.\nFinally, we define the necessary encodings.

(6.4 minutes) a validator proposes an attestation to the network. The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The attestation contains the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)</li>\n<li>data: details relating to the attestation, as defined below</li>\n<li>signature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slot: The slot number that the attestation refers to</li>\n<li>index: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot</li>\n<li>beacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)</li>\n<li>source: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block</li>\n<li>target: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.</p>\n<p>Finally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p>Following is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.\nThe attestation contains the following components:\n\naggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)\ndata: details relating to the attestation, as defined below\nsignature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators\n\nThe first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:\n\nslot: The slot number that the attestation refers to\nindex: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot\nbeacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)\nsource: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block\ntarget: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch\n\nOnce the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.\nFinally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.\n\nTechnical Details\nFollowing is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations. For data structures, please see Beacon State Data Structures from Prysm and web3signer_types from prysm.\nBeaconState contains both a ReadOnlyBeaconState and a WriteOnlyBeaconState wich contain ReadOnlyValidators and ReadOnlyRandaoMixes and WriteOnlyValidators and WriteOnlyRandaoMixes respectively.\nAt the beginning of each epoch func ProcessRandaoMixesReset processes the final updates to RANDAO mix during epoch processing. This calls RandaoMix which returns the randao mix (xor&#x27;ed seed) of a given slot. It is used to shuffle validators.\nFollowing are sample mixes generated from func TestRandaoMix_OK by adding the statement fmt.Printf(&quot;mix: %v\\n&quot;, mix)\nmix: [10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [40 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [159 134 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nThe shuffle functions consist of\n\n\nfunc ShuffleList: returns list of shuffled indexes in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\nFollowing is an example of a shuffled list generated from TestShuffleList_OK\nlist1: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\nseed1: [1 128 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nshuffledList1: [0 7 8 6 3 9 4 5 2 1]\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndex: returns p(index) in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy.

This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndices: ShuffledIndices uses input beacon state and returns the shuffled indices of the input epoch, the shuffled indices then can be used to break up into committees.\n\n\nCommittes are formed using functions from beacon_comittee.go\n\n\nfunc BeaconComittee: returns the beacon committee of a given slot and committee index. The validator indices and seed are provided as an argument rather than an imported implementation from the spec definition. Having them as an argument allows for cheaper computation run time. (This is an optomized version of func BeaconComitteFromState)\nFollowing is an example of a beaconComittee generated by adding the following lines to TestBeaconCommitteeFromState_UpdateCacheForPreviousEpoch:\n\n\nvar beaconCommittee []types.ValidatorIndex\nbeaconCommittee, err = BeaconCommitteeFromState(context.Background(), state, 1 /_previous
