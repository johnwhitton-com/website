This uses (RLP) Serialization\nNote: The shims in ethWeb3.js provide simplified functions for ContractAt, ContractDeploy, sendTx and addPrivateKey and have a constructor which uses process.env.PRIVATE_KEY.\nMapping the Tokens\n# Map the Tokens\n# map &lt;ethUrl&gt; &lt;ethBridge&gt; &lt;hmyUrl&gt; &lt;hmyBridge&gt; &lt;token&gt;\nyarn cli Bridge map http://localhost:8645 0x017f8C7d1Cb04dE974B8aC1a6B8d3d74bC74E7E1 http://localhost:9500 0x017f8C7d1Cb04dE974B8aC1a6B8d3d74bC74E7E1 0x4e59AeD3aCbb0cb66AF94E893BEE7df8B414dAB1\nImplementation\n\nThe CLI calls tokenMap in src/bridge/contract.js to\n\nInstantiate the Ethereum Bridge and Harmony Bridge Contracts\nCalls TokenMap in scr/bridge/bridge.js to\n\nIssue a token Map request on Ethereum const mapReq = await src.IssueTokenMapReq(token)\nAcknowledge the Map Request on Harmony const mapAck = await Bridge.CrossRelayEthHmy(src, dest, mapReq)\nIssue a token Map request on Harmony return Bridge.CrossRelayHmyEth(dest, src, mapAck.transactionHash)\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the Logic (call execution overview) when Mapping Tokens across Chains.

These two data types allow a client to stay up-to-date with the beacon chain.\nThese two data types are placed into separate sub-networks. A light client make find-content requests on skip-sync-network at start of the sync to get a header with the same SyncCommittee object as in the current sync period. The client uses messages in the gossip topic bc-light-client-update to advance its header.\nThe gossip topics described in this document is part of a proposal for a beacon chain light client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","title":"The Portal Network","titles":["Ethereum Near Bridging","Ethereum 2.0 Light Client Support","Light Client Specification"]},"57":{"href":"/research/code/ethereum-near#transaction-proofs","html":"\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/master/beacon-chain/beacon-state-network.mdx\">Retrieving Beacon State</a>: A client has a trusted beacon state root, and it wants to access some parts of the state.

It feels that this would be expensive to update Ethereum so frequently. <a href=\"https://near.org/bridge/\">NEAR&#x27;s bridge documentation</a> states <em>Sending assets from NEAR back to Ethereum currently takes a maximum of sixteen hours (due to Ethereum finality times)</em>. This seems to align with sending light client updates once per NEAR epoch. The block fetch period is configurable in the relayer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it.

(6.4 minutes) a validator proposes an attestation to the network. The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The attestation contains the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)</li>\n<li>data: details relating to the attestation, as defined below</li>\n<li>signature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slot: The slot number that the attestation refers to</li>\n<li>index: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot</li>\n<li>beacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)</li>\n<li>source: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block</li>\n<li>target: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.</p>\n<p>Finally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p>Following is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.\nThe attestation contains the following components:\n\naggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)\ndata: details relating to the attestation, as defined below\nsignature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators\n\nThe first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:\n\nslot: The slot number that the attestation refers to\nindex: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot\nbeacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)\nsource: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block\ntarget: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch\n\nOnce the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.\nFinally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.\n\nTechnical Details\nFollowing is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations. For data structures, please see Beacon State Data Structures from Prysm and web3signer_types from prysm.\nBeaconState contains both a ReadOnlyBeaconState and a WriteOnlyBeaconState wich contain ReadOnlyValidators and ReadOnlyRandaoMixes and WriteOnlyValidators and WriteOnlyRandaoMixes respectively.\nAt the beginning of each epoch func ProcessRandaoMixesReset processes the final updates to RANDAO mix during epoch processing. This calls RandaoMix which returns the randao mix (xor&#x27;ed seed) of a given slot. It is used to shuffle validators.\nFollowing are sample mixes generated from func TestRandaoMix_OK by adding the statement fmt.Printf(&quot;mix: %v\\n&quot;, mix)\nmix: [10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [40 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [159 134 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nThe shuffle functions consist of\n\n\nfunc ShuffleList: returns list of shuffled indexes in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\nFollowing is an example of a shuffled list generated from TestShuffleList_OK\nlist1: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\nseed1: [1 128 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nshuffledList1: [0 7 8 6 3 9 4 5 2 1]\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndex: returns p(index) in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy.

This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndices: ShuffledIndices uses input beacon state and returns the shuffled indices of the input epoch, the shuffled indices then can be used to break up into committees.\n\n\nCommittes are formed using functions from beacon_comittee.go\n\n\nfunc BeaconComittee: returns the beacon committee of a given slot and committee index. The validator indices and seed are provided as an argument rather than an imported implementation from the spec definition. Having them as an argument allows for cheaper computation run time. (This is an optomized version of func BeaconComitteFromState)\nFollowing is an example of a beaconComittee generated by adding the following lines to TestBeaconCommitteeFromState_UpdateCacheForPreviousEpoch:\n\n\nvar beaconCommittee []types.ValidatorIndex\nbeaconCommittee, err = BeaconCommitteeFromState(context.Background(), state, 1 /_previous

Users can create arbitrary subnets in Avalanche, and any validator is free to participate the consensus for any subnet<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-ov-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-ov-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">1</a></sup>, besides the mandatory participation of the special subnet - the Primary Network. Each subnet has three types of chains, each with different roles and runs different consensus mechanism and process different transaction types: (1) P-Chain, which defines validator sets and process validator related transactions; (2) X-Chain, for exchanging assets, where blocks are partially ordered; (3) C-Chain, which runs an EVM and handles smart contract interactions <sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-ov-2\" id=\"user-content-fnref-ov-2\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><em>Note: On march 23rd, 2023 Avalanche published an article<sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-ov-18\" id=\"user-content-fnref-ov-18\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">3</a></sup> giving an overviow of the Cortina release, it&#x27;s move to linearize the X-chain to enable support for WARP messaging.</em></p>\n<p>We limit our scope to only the <strong>Primary Network</strong>, since any bridging implementation is likely replicable in subnets, and subnets are likely to be interoperable soon. For trustless bridging, only events from <strong>C-Chain</strong> are relevant, since the bridge must be a smart contract and all cross-chain operations can be conveniently wrapped inside contract interactions.</p>\n<p>The active Avalanche validator set is unrestricted and permissionless, and has more than 1000 members at this time <sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-ov-3\" id=\"user-content-fnref-ov-3\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">4</a></sup>.

Users can create arbitrary subnets in Avalanche, and any validator is free to participate the consensus for any subnet1, besides the mandatory participation of the special subnet - the Primary Network. Each subnet has three types of chains, each with different roles and runs different consensus mechanism and process different transaction types: (1) P-Chain, which defines validator sets and process validator related transactions; (2) X-Chain, for exchanging assets, where blocks are partially ordered; (3) C-Chain, which runs an EVM and handles smart contract interactions 2.\nNote: On march 23rd, 2023 Avalanche published an article3 giving an overviow of the Cortina release, it&#x27;s move to linearize the X-chain to enable support for WARP messaging.\nWe limit our scope to only the Primary Network, since any bridging implementation is likely replicable in subnets, and subnets are likely to be interoperable soon. For trustless bridging, only events from C-Chain are relevant, since the bridge must be a smart contract and all cross-chain operations can be conveniently wrapped inside contract interactions.\nThe active Avalanche validator set is unrestricted and permissionless, and has more than 1000 members at this time 4. Block proposers are randomly sampled from the active validator set, therefore any validator could potentially sign a block 5. The validators use X.509 (TLS)certificate to sign and verify blocks 6, and the block headers contain both the certificate and the signature 7. Neither Avalanche documentation or code specifies the key and signing algorithms for the X.509 certificate, but the certificate auto-generated by the code (invoked via validator command-line tools) creates 4096-bit RSA key by default 8.\nIn recent releases9 10 11 12 13 14 of Avalanche, validators may also load or generate an optional BLS key. This is to support Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) 15 16 supporting inter-subnet messaging. This suggests the protocol may replace its signature scheme from RSA to BLS in the near future.\nNote that RSA signature can be cheaply verified on-chain, per EIP-198 17 .

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The attestation contains the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)</li>\n<li>data: details relating to the attestation, as defined below</li>\n<li>signature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slot: The slot number that the attestation refers to</li>\n<li>index: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot</li>\n<li>beacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)</li>\n<li>source: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block</li>\n<li>target: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.</p>\n<p>Finally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p>Following is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.\nThe attestation contains the following components:\n\naggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)\ndata: details relating to the attestation, as defined below\nsignature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators\n\nThe first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:\n\nslot: The slot number that the attestation refers to\nindex: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot\nbeacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)\nsource: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block\ntarget: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch\n\nOnce the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.\nFinally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.\n\nTechnical Details\nFollowing is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations. For data structures, please see Beacon State Data Structures from Prysm and web3signer_types from prysm.\nBeaconState contains both a ReadOnlyBeaconState and a WriteOnlyBeaconState wich contain ReadOnlyValidators and ReadOnlyRandaoMixes and WriteOnlyValidators and WriteOnlyRandaoMixes respectively.\nAt the beginning of each epoch func ProcessRandaoMixesReset processes the final updates to RANDAO mix during epoch processing. This calls RandaoMix which returns the randao mix (xor&#x27;ed seed) of a given slot. It is used to shuffle validators.\nFollowing are sample mixes generated from func TestRandaoMix_OK by adding the statement fmt.Printf(&quot;mix: %v\\n&quot;, mix)\nmix: [10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [40 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [159 134 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nThe shuffle functions consist of\n\n\nfunc ShuffleList: returns list of shuffled indexes in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\nFollowing is an example of a shuffled list generated from TestShuffleList_OK\nlist1: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\nseed1: [1 128 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nshuffledList1: [0 7 8 6 3 9 4 5 2 1]\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndex: returns p(index) in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndices: ShuffledIndices uses input beacon state and returns the shuffled indices of the input epoch, the shuffled indices then can be used to break up into committees.\n\n\nCommittes are formed using functions from beacon_comittee.go\n\n\nfunc BeaconComittee: returns the beacon committee of a given slot and committee index. The validator indices and seed are provided as an argument rather than an imported implementation from the spec definition. Having them as an argument allows for cheaper computation run time. (This is an optomized version of func BeaconComitteFromState)\nFollowing is an example of a beaconComittee generated by adding the following lines to TestBeaconCommitteeFromState_UpdateCacheForPreviousEpoch:\nvar beaconCommittee []types.ValidatorIndex\nbeaconCommittee, err = BeaconCommitteeFromState(context.Background(), state, 1 /_previous

It determines the security and performance of a blockchain and is often referred to as the &quot;engine&quot; of a blockchain. Harmony’s consensus algorithm is called Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT), which is an innovative upgrade on the famous PBFT algorithm. FBFT is one order of magnitude faster and more scalable than PBFT because BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) aggregate signature is used to significantly reduce the communication cost. Specifically, FBFT allows at least 250 validators to reach consensus within 2 seconds.</p>\n<p>For every round of consensus in FBFT, one validator serves as the “leader” and there are three phases: the announce phase, the prepare phase and the commit phase. In the announce phase, the leader proposes a new block and broadcasts the block hash to all of the validators. In the prepare phase, validators verify the message and sign on the block hash, as well as sending the signature back to the leader. The prepare phase finishes when signatures with more than 2/3 of the voting power are collected. After that, the leader aggregated the collected signatures into a O(1)-sized BLS aggregate signature and then broadcast it with the whole block to start the commit phase. The commit phase involves validators verifying the block and doing a similar signing process as the prepare phase (i.e. 2/3 voting power collection). The consensus is reached after the commit phase is done. This whole process can be done within 2 seconds in mainnet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following is an excerpt from <a href=\"https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/definitions/epoch-transition\">Epoch Transition</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An epoch is a period of time when the beacon shard (i.e. shard 0, the coordinator for other shards) produces a fixed number of blocks. In Harmony mainnet, an epoch is 32768 blocks (~18.2h with a 2s block time) in the beacon shard</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Note: If the leader fails to produce a block within a certain time frame, then a new leader is elected</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets//research/harmony-consensus.png\" alt=\"Harmony FBFT\" title=\"Harmony FBFT\"/></p>\n<p>Block Structure from <a href=\"https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/blob/main/block/v3/header.go\">harmony</a></p>\n<pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark-dimmed\" style=\"background-color:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#22272e;color:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#adbac7\" tabindex=\"0\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\">type headerFields struct {</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#24292E;--shiki-dark:#ADBAC7\"> ParentHash          common.Hash    </span><span style=\"color:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#6CB6FF\">`json:&quot;parentHash&quot;

It determines the security and performance of a blockchain and is often referred to as the &quot;engine&quot; of a blockchain. Harmony’s consensus algorithm is called Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT), which is an innovative upgrade on the famous PBFT algorithm. FBFT is one order of magnitude faster and more scalable than PBFT because BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) aggregate signature is used to significantly reduce the communication cost. Specifically, FBFT allows at least 250 validators to reach consensus within 2 seconds.\nFor every round of consensus in FBFT, one validator serves as the “leader” and there are three phases: the announce phase, the prepare phase and the commit phase. In the announce phase, the leader proposes a new block and broadcasts the block hash to all of the validators. In the prepare phase, validators verify the message and sign on the block hash, as well as sending the signature back to the leader. The prepare phase finishes when signatures with more than 2/3 of the voting power are collected. After that, the leader aggregated the collected signatures into a O(1)-sized BLS aggregate signature and then broadcast it with the whole block to start the commit phase. The commit phase involves validators verifying the block and doing a similar signing process as the prepare phase (i.e. 2/3 voting power collection). The consensus is reached after the commit phase is done. This whole process can be done within 2 seconds in mainnet.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from Epoch Transition\n\nAn epoch is a period of time when the beacon shard (i.e. shard 0, the coordinator for other shards) produces a fixed number of blocks. In Harmony mainnet, an epoch is 32768 blocks (~18.2h with a 2s block time) in the beacon shard\n\nNote: If the leader fails to produce a block within a certain time frame, then a new leader is elected\n\nBlock Structure from harmony\ntype headerFields struct {\n ParentHash          common.Hash    `json:&quot;parentHash&quot;       gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Coinbase            common.Address `json:&quot;miner&quot;            gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Root                common.Hash    `json:&quot;stateRoot&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n TxHash              common.Hash    `json:&quot;transactionsRoot&quot; gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n ReceiptHash         common.Hash    `json:&quot;receiptsRoot&quot;     gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n OutgoingReceiptHash common.Hash    `json:&quot;outgoingReceiptsRoot&quot;     gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n IncomingReceiptHash common.Hash    `json:&quot;incomingReceiptsRoot&quot; gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Bloom               ethtypes.Bloom `json:&quot;logsBloom&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Number              *big.Int       `json:&quot;number&quot;           gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n GasLimit            uint64         `json:&quot;gasLimit&quot;         gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n GasUsed             uint64         `json:&quot;gasUsed&quot;          gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Time                *big.Int       `json:&quot;timestamp&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Extra               []byte         `json:&quot;extraData&quot;        gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n MixDigest           common.Hash    `json:&quot;mixHash&quot;          gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n // Additional Fields\n ViewID              *big.Int `json:&quot;viewID&quot;           gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n Epoch               *big.Int `json:&quot;epoch&quot;            gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n ShardID             uint32   `json:&quot;shardID&quot;          gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n LastCommitSignature [96]byte `json:&quot;lastCommitSignature&quot;  gencodec:&quot;required&quot;`\n LastCommitBitmap    []byte   `json:&quot;lastCommitBitmap&quot;     gencodec:&quot;required&quot;` // Contains which validator signed\n Vrf                 []byte   `json:&quot;vrf&quot;`\n Vdf                 []byte   `json:&quot;vdf&quot;`\n ShardState          []byte   `json:&quot;shardState&quot;`\n CrossLinks          []byte   `json:&quot;crossLink&quot;`\n Slashes             []byte   `json:&quot;slashes&quot;`\n}\n","title":"Harmony Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT)","titles":["Harmony","Consensus Mechanism"]},"235":{"href":"/research/chains/harmony#signing-mechanism","html":"\n<p>Harmony uses BLS12_381 signatures for validators signing blocks.

At a high level the light client needs to fetch at least one block per <a href=\"https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/epoch\">epoch</a> i.e. every 42,200 blocks or approxmiately 12 hours. Also Having the LightClientBlockView for block $B$ is sufficient to be able to verify any statement about state or outcomes in any block in the ancestry of $B$ (including $B$ itself).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it. Specifically, it either returns the last final block of the next epoch, or the last final known block.

Then anyone can challenge a signature in a submitted header within a 4-hour challenge window. The challenge requires verification of a single Ed25519 signature which would cost about 500k Ethereum gas (expensive, but possible). The user submitting the NEAR header would have to post a bond in Ethereum tokens, and a successful challenge would burn half of the bond and return the other half to the challenger. The bond should be large enough to pay for the gas even if the gas price increases exponentially during the 4 hours. For instance, a 20 ETH bond would cover gas price hikes up to 20000 Gwei. This optimistic approach requires having a watchdog service that monitors submitted NEAR headers and challenges any headers with invalid signatures. For added security, independent users can run several watchdog services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","isPage":false,"text":"\nNEAR Light Client Documentation gives an overview of how light clients work. At a high level the light client needs to fetch at least one block per epoch i.e. every 42,200 blocks or approxmiately 12 hours. Also Having the LightClientBlockView for block $B$ is sufficient to be able to verify any statement about state or outcomes in any block in the ancestry of $B$ (including $B$ itself).\n\nThe RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it. Specifically, it either returns the last final block of the next epoch, or the last final known block. If there&#x27;s no newer final block than the one the light client knows about, the RPC returns an empty result.\nA standalone light client would bootstrap by requesting next blocks until it receives an empty result, and then periodically request the next light client block.\nA smart contract-based light client that enables a bridge to NEAR on a different blockchain naturally cannot request blocks itself.

The attacker deposited a bunch of their own ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now only worth 60 ETH. Even if there&#x27;s a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that fully validates consensus, it&#x27;s still vulnerable to theft through 51% attacks like this.</p>\n<p>It&#x27;s always safer to hold Ethereum-native assets on Ethereum or Solana-native assets on Solana than it is to hold Ethereum-native assets on Solana or Solana-native assets on Ethereum. And in this context, &quot;Ethereum&quot; refers not just to the base chain, but also any proper L2 that is built on it. If Ethereum gets 51% attacked and reverts, Arbitrum and Optimism revert too, and so &quot;cross-rollup&quot; applications that hold state on Arbitrum and Optimism are guaranteed to remain consistent even if Ethereum gets 51% attacked. And if Ethereum does not get 51% attacked, there&#x27;s no way to 51% attack Arbitrum and Optimism separately. Hence, holding assets issued on Optimism wrapped on Arbitrum is still perfectly safe.</p>\n<p>Why a rollup can&#x27;t just &quot;go use another data layer&quot;. If a rollup stores its data on Celestia or BCH or whatever else but deals with assets on Ethereum, if that layer gets 51% attacked you&#x27;re screwed. The DAS on Celestia providing 51% attack resistance doesn&#x27;t actually help you because the Ethereum network isn&#x27;t reading that DAS; it would be reading a bridge, which would be vulnerable to 51% attacks. To be a rollup that provides security to applications using Ethereum-native assets, you have to use the Ethereum data layer (and likewise for any other ecosystem).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here are some sample hacks</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/\">Vulnerabilities in Cross-chain Bridge Protocols Emerge as Top Security Risk</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Following last night’s exploit of the Nomad Bridge, Chainalysis estimates that $2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen across 13 separate cross-chain bridge hacks, the majority of which was stolen this year. Attacks on bridges account for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022 so far.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://halborn.com/explained-the-qubit-hack-january-2022/\">EXPLAINED: THE QUBIT HACK (JANUARY 2022)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The exploited contract used a modified safeTransferFrom() function which instead of making use of functionCall() to verify that the target address contained contract code, used the call() function directly.

The attacker deposited a bunch of their own ETH into Solana-WETH and then reverted that transaction on the Ethereum side as soon as the Solana side confirmed it. The Solana-WETH contract is now no longer fully backed, and perhaps your 100 Solana-WETH is now only worth 60 ETH. Even if there&#x27;s a perfect ZK-SNARK-based bridge that fully validates consensus, it&#x27;s still vulnerable to theft through 51% attacks like this.\nIt&#x27;s always safer to hold Ethereum-native assets on Ethereum or Solana-native assets on Solana than it is to hold Ethereum-native assets on Solana or Solana-native assets on Ethereum. And in this context, &quot;Ethereum&quot; refers not just to the base chain, but also any proper L2 that is built on it. If Ethereum gets 51% attacked and reverts, Arbitrum and Optimism revert too, and so &quot;cross-rollup&quot; applications that hold state on Arbitrum and Optimism are guaranteed to remain consistent even if Ethereum gets 51% attacked. And if Ethereum does not get 51% attacked, there&#x27;s no way to 51% attack Arbitrum and Optimism separately. Hence, holding assets issued on Optimism wrapped on Arbitrum is still perfectly safe.\nWhy a rollup can&#x27;t just &quot;go use another data layer&quot;. If a rollup stores its data on Celestia or BCH or whatever else but deals with assets on Ethereum, if that layer gets 51% attacked you&#x27;re screwed. The DAS on Celestia providing 51% attack resistance doesn&#x27;t actually help you because the Ethereum network isn&#x27;t reading that DAS; it would be reading a bridge, which would be vulnerable to 51% attacks. To be a rollup that provides security to applications using Ethereum-native assets, you have to use the Ethereum data layer (and likewise for any other ecosystem).\n\nHere are some sample hacks\n\nVulnerabilities in Cross-chain Bridge Protocols Emerge as Top Security Risk\n\n\nFollowing last night’s exploit of the Nomad Bridge, Chainalysis estimates that $2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen across 13 separate cross-chain bridge hacks, the majority of which was stolen this year. Attacks on bridges account for 69% of total funds stolen in 2022 so far.\n\n\nEXPLAINED: THE QUBIT HACK (JANUARY 2022)\n\n\nThe exploited contract used a modified safeTransferFrom() function which instead of making use of functionCall() to verify that the target address contained contract code, used the call() function directly. As the 0 address has no code at all, no code is run, and the call is completed successfully without reverting. As a result, the deposit function executed successfully but no real tokens were deposited.\nThe Ethereum QBridge caught the Deposit event and interpreted it as a valid deposit of ETH. As a result, qXETH tokens were minted for the attacker on BSC.\n\n\nEXPLAINED: THE WORMHOLE HACK (FEBRUARY 2022)\n\n\nThe actual extraction of 120k ETH from the Wormhole bridge came at the end of a series of events. The actual flow of the attack was:\n\nThe attacker creates a validator action approval (VAA) with a call to post_vaa\nThis VAA was used in a call to complete_wrapped to mint the 120,000 ETH extracted in the attack\nThe attacker “legitimately” extracted the minted tokens from the bridge\n\nThe vulnerability that made the attack possible was a failure to perform proper signature verification in the VAA creation process. The role of signature verification is delegated several times from post_vaa to verify_signatures to Secp256k1.\n\n\nEXPLAINED: THE RONIN HACK (MARCH 2022)\n\n\nThe Ronin Network attack was extremely stealthy. In fact, the hack wasn’t noticed until six days after it occurred when the project team was notified by a user that they couldn’t withdraw about 5k ETH from the project’s bridge. Further investigation discovered the largest hack in DeFi history to date.\nThe Ronin Network hack was made possible by compromised private keys. The Ronin Network uses a set of nine validator nodes to approve transactions on the bridge, and a deposit or withdrawal requires approval by a majority of five of these nodes. The attacker gained control of four validators controlled by Sky Mavis and a third-party Axie DAO validator that signed their malicious transactions.\n\n\nEXPLAINED: THE HARMONY HORIZON BRIDGE HACK\n\n\nLike most cross-chain bridges, the Harmony Horizon Bridge has a validation process for approving transactions being transferred over the bridge. In this case, the approvals process uses a multi-signature scheme with five validators.\nHowever, the bridge only used a 2 of 5 validation scheme. This means that only two blockchain accounts needed to be compromised for an attacker to approve any malicious transaction that they wished.\nThe Harmony Horizon bridge was exploited via the theft of two private keys. These private keys were encrypted with both a passphrase and a key management service, and no system had access to multiple plaintext keys. However, the attacker managed to access and decrypt multiple keys.\nWith access to two of the bridge’s private keys, the attacker could create a transaction extracting $100 million from the bridge and confirm it using two accounts under their control.\n\n\nTHE NOMAD BRIDGE HACK: A DEEPER DIVE\n\n\nOn August 1, DeFi bridge Nomad was hacked for over $190M.\nAfter a frenzied hack from hundreds of wallets, the bridge’s TVL dropped from $190,740,000 to $1,794 in mere hours. The hack involved a total of 960 transactions with 1,175 individual withdrawals from the bridge.\nAccording to Nomad’s post-mortem, an implementation bug in a June 21 smart contract upgrade caused the Replica contract to fail to authenticate messages properly. This issue meant that any message could be forged as long as it had not already been processed.\nAs a result, contracts relying on the Replica for authentication of inbound messages suffered security failures.

At a high level the light client needs to fetch at least one block per <a href=\"https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/epoch\">epoch</a> i.e. every 42,200 blocks or approxmiately 12 hours. Also Having the LightClientBlockView for block B is sufficient to be able to verify any statement about state or outcomes in any block in the ancestry of B (including B itself).</p>\n<p>The current scripts and codebase indicates that a block would be fetched every 30 seconds with a max delay of 10 seconds. It feels that this would be expensive to update Ethereum so frequently. <a href=\"https://near.org/bridge/\">NEAR&#x27;s bridge documentation</a> states <em>Sending assets from NEAR back to Ethereum currently takes a maximum of sixteen hours (due to Ethereum finality times)</em>. This seems to align with sending light client updates once per NEAR epoch. The block fetch period is configurable in the relayer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it. Specifically, it either returns the last final block of the next epoch, or the last final known block. If there&#x27;s no newer final block than the one the light client knows about, the RPC returns an empty result.</p>\n<p>A standalone light client would bootstrap by requesting next blocks until it receives an empty result, and then periodically request the next light client block.</p>\n<p>A smart contract-based light client that enables a bridge to NEAR on a different blockchain naturally cannot request blocks itself. Instead external oracles query the next light client block from one of the full nodes, and submit it to the light client smart contract. The smart contract-based light client performs the same checks described above, so the oracle doesn&#x27;t need to be trusted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Block Submitters stake ETH to be allowed to submit blocks which get&#x27;s slashed if the watchdog identifies blocks with invalid signatures.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Have not identified how the block submitters are rewarded for submitting blocks.

At a high level the light client needs to fetch at least one block per epoch i.e. every 42,200 blocks or approxmiately 12 hours. Also Having the LightClientBlockView for block B is sufficient to be able to verify any statement about state or outcomes in any block in the ancestry of B (including B itself).\nThe current scripts and codebase indicates that a block would be fetched every 30 seconds with a max delay of 10 seconds. It feels that this would be expensive to update Ethereum so frequently. NEAR&#x27;s bridge documentation states Sending assets from NEAR back to Ethereum currently takes a maximum of sixteen hours (due to Ethereum finality times). This seems to align with sending light client updates once per NEAR epoch. The block fetch period is configurable in the relayer.\n\nThe RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it. Specifically, it either returns the last final block of the next epoch, or the last final known block. If there&#x27;s no newer final block than the one the light client knows about, the RPC returns an empty result.\nA standalone light client would bootstrap by requesting next blocks until it receives an empty result, and then periodically request the next light client block.\nA smart contract-based light client that enables a bridge to NEAR on a different blockchain naturally cannot request blocks itself. Instead external oracles query the next light client block from one of the full nodes, and submit it to the light client smart contract. The smart contract-based light client performs the same checks described above, so the oracle doesn&#x27;t need to be trusted.\n\nBlock Submitters stake ETH to be allowed to submit blocks which get&#x27;s slashed if the watchdog identifies blocks with invalid signatures.\nNote: Have not identified how the block submitters are rewarded for submitting blocks. Currently have only identified them locking ETH to be able to submit blocks and being slashed if they submit blocks with invalid signatures.\n\n\nLight Clients are deployed on Ethereum via the CLI using eth-contracts.js\n\ninit-eth-ed25519: Deploys Ed25519.sol see more information under nearbridge Cryptographic Primitives\ninit-eth-client: Deploys NearBridge.sol see more information under NEAR to Ethereum block propagation components.

Because we don’t want to do this for every single header verification proof (which happens every 6 minutes, i.e. once per epoch), we use an additional SNARK (the commitmentMappingProof argument) to provably map an SSZ commitment to a SNARK-friendly Poseidon commitment, that is stored in the mapping sszToPoseidon. For each BLS signature verification, we pass in the poseidon commitment of the sync committee validators as public input to ensure that the BLS signature we are verifying is from the correct public keys. Overall this approach (using 2 SNARKs) saves us 70M constraints on the BLS signature verification SNARK, which we must run for every update we wish to submit to the light client.
