Blockchains also interact with the P2P layer and the chain router to send and receive messages.\n\n\nIn the case of the C-Chain, avalanche uses coreth23 a modified version of geth, as it&#x27;s vm to provide EVM support. It also uses Snowman++ 24 as a congestion controle mechanism, effectively pre-selecting a set of proposers and giving them a submission window to submit blocks. If they fail to submit within their WindowDuration then any other validator can issue the block.\nBelow is an excerpt of how Snowman vms 25 and the consensus engine work.\n\nImplementing the Snowman VM Block\nFrom the perspective of the consensus engine, the state of the VM can be defined as a linear chain starting from the genesis block through to the last accepted block.\nFollowing the last accepted block, the consensus engine may have any number of different blocks that are processing. The configuration of the processing set can be defined as a tree with the last accepted block as the root.\nIn practice, this looks like the following:\n   G\n   |\n   .\n   .\n   .\n   |\n   L\n   |\n   A\n /   \\\nB     C\n\n","title":"Snowman Consensus","titles":["Avalanche","Consensus Mechanisms"]},"45":{"href":"/research/chains/avalanche#signing-mechanisms","html":"\n","isPage":false,"text":"\n","title":"Signing Mechanisms","titles":["Avalanche"]},"46":{"href":"/research/chains/avalanche#consensus-signing-mechanism","html":"\n<p>Avalanche is not prescriptive about addressing schemes, choosing to instead leave addressing up to each blockchain <sup><a href=\"#user-content-fn-sig-1\" id=\"user-content-fnref-sig-1\" data-footnote-ref=\"true\" aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\">26</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Avalanche uses Transport Layer Security, TLS, to protect node-to-node communications from eavesdroppers.

A proof-of-work (PoW) is a protocol that is difficult to compute but easy to verify. It can be verified in far less time than it took to compute in first place. The process involves scanning for a value that when hashed, (such as with SHA-256), the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. In simple words, Proof of work is an expensive computation done by all miners to compete to find a number that, when added to the block of transactions, causes this block to hash to a code with certain rare properties. Finding such a rare number is hard (based on the cryptographic features of the hash function used in this process), but verifying its validity when it&#x27;s found is relatively easy. One can take the challenge, the proof string and hash them together and check if the hash begins with a number of zero bits.

A proof-of-work (PoW) is a protocol that is difficult to compute but easy to verify. It can be verified in far less time than it took to compute in first place. The process involves scanning for a value that when hashed, (such as with SHA-256), the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. In simple words, Proof of work is an expensive computation done by all miners to compete to find a number that, when added to the block of transactions, causes this block to hash to a code with certain rare properties. Finding such a rare number is hard (based on the cryptographic features of the hash function used in this process), but verifying its validity when it&#x27;s found is relatively easy. One can take the challenge, the proof string and hash them together and check if the hash begins with a number of zero bits. This requires to apply the hash function just once and verify the output indeed has requisite numbers of 0&#x27;s in front. If so, then the proof of work is considered valid under the application of that cryptographic hash function.

In proof-of-work, miners prove they have capital at risk by expending energy. Ethereum uses proof-of-stake, where validators explicitly stake capital in the form of ETH into a smart contract on Ethereum.

Here we give an overview of Proof of Stake Followed by a deep dive into synch committees.\nFollowing is an excerpt from Ethereum Orgs Proof of Stake document\n\nWhat is proof-of-stake (PoS)?\n\n\nProof-of-stake underlies certain consensus mechanisms used by blockchains to achieve distributed consensus. In proof-of-work, miners prove they have capital at risk by expending energy. Ethereum uses proof-of-stake, where validators explicitly stake capital in the form of ETH into a smart contract on Ethereum.

Execution block hash you can find at BeaconBlockBody.execution_payload.block_hash.\nSo, for creating Merkle proof, we need two levels of Merkle Tree, as shown in the picture. Both Merkle trees you can find in beacon_block_body_merkle_tree.rs The first level Merkle tree for beacon block body and the second level Merkle tree for execution payload.\nThe execution block hash proof creation you can find in execution_block_proof.rs First, we build two Merkle trees and concatenate together the Merkle proof for block_hash in execution_payload and the Merkle proof of execution_payload in beacon_block_body. The final Merkle proof is shown by the orange vertices on the picture; the orange numbers in the picture are the order of hashes in the proof.\nbeacon_block_header_with_execution_data.rs contain a structure which consists of beacon_block_header and correspondent execution_block_hash with Merkle proof. This structure is created for finality blocks in a light client update.\n\n","title":"Light Client Support","titles":["Ethereum"]},"97":{"href":"/research/chains/ethereum#references","html":"\n<strong>Consensus</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03052.pdf\">Gasper Consensus Whitepaper</a>: Combining GHOST and Casper</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/blob/stable/consensus/types/src/beacon_block.rs#L7\">sigp lighthouse beacon block</a>: Beacon Block codebase (rust)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name=\"bp1\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3675#pow-block-processing\">EIP-3675: Upgrade consensus to\nProof-of-Stake</a>:\nSpecification of the consensus mechanism upgrade on Ethereum Mainnet that\nintroduces Proof-of-Stake.</p>\n<p><a name=\"bp2\">[2]</a> <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2982\">EIP-2982: Serenity Phase\n0</a>: Phase 0 of the release schedule of\nSerenity, a series of updates to Ethereum a scalable, proof-of-stake consensus.</p>\n<p><a name=\"bp3\">[3]</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/phase0\">Ethreum Consensus Specs Phase\n0</a>:\nSpecifications for Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 including\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.mdx\">beacon-chain</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/deposit-contract.mdx\">deposit-contract</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.mdx\">fork-choice</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.mdx\">p2p-interface</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.mdx\">validator</a>\nand\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/weak-subjectivity.mdx\">weak-subjectivity</a></p>\n<p><a name=\"bp4\">[6]</a> <a href=\"https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution\">Ethereum Consensus and Execution Client\nDistribution</a>: Percentages of nodes\nrunning client types for both Consensus (Prysm, Lighthours, Nimbus, Teku) and\nExecution (Geth, Erigon, Besu, Nethermind) clients.</p>\n<p><a name=\"bp5\">[5]</a> <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum@v1.10.26\">go-ethereum go\ndocumentation</a>:\nDocumentation for Go Ethereum, Official Golang implementation of the Ethereum\nprotocol.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The attestation contains the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)</li>\n<li>data: details relating to the attestation, as defined below</li>\n<li>signature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slot: The slot number that the attestation refers to</li>\n<li>index: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot</li>\n<li>beacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)</li>\n<li>source: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block</li>\n<li>target: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.</p>\n<p>Finally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p>Following is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.\nThe attestation contains the following components:\n\naggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)\ndata: details relating to the attestation, as defined below\nsignature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators\n\nThe first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:\n\nslot: The slot number that the attestation refers to\nindex: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot\nbeacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)\nsource: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block\ntarget: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch\n\nOnce the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.\nFinally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.\n\nTechnical Details\nFollowing is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations. For data structures, please see Beacon State Data Structures from Prysm and web3signer_types from prysm.\nBeaconState contains both a ReadOnlyBeaconState and a WriteOnlyBeaconState wich contain ReadOnlyValidators and ReadOnlyRandaoMixes and WriteOnlyValidators and WriteOnlyRandaoMixes respectively.\nAt the beginning of each epoch func ProcessRandaoMixesReset processes the final updates to RANDAO mix during epoch processing. This calls RandaoMix which returns the randao mix (xor&#x27;ed seed) of a given slot. It is used to shuffle validators.\nFollowing are sample mixes generated from func TestRandaoMix_OK by adding the statement fmt.Printf(&quot;mix: %v\\n&quot;, mix)\nmix: [10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [40 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [159 134 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nThe shuffle functions consist of\n\n\nfunc ShuffleList: returns list of shuffled indexes in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\nFollowing is an example of a shuffled list generated from TestShuffleList_OK\nlist1: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\nseed1: [1 128 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nshuffledList1: [0 7 8 6 3 9 4 5 2 1]\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndex: returns p(index) in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndices: ShuffledIndices uses input beacon state and returns the shuffled indices of the input epoch, the shuffled indices then can be used to break up into committees.\n\n\nCommittes are formed using functions from beacon_comittee.go\n\n\nfunc BeaconComittee: returns the beacon committee of a given slot and committee index. The validator indices and seed are provided as an argument rather than an imported implementation from the spec definition. Having them as an argument allows for cheaper computation run time. (This is an optomized version of func BeaconComitteFromState)\nFollowing is an example of a beaconComittee generated by adding the following lines to TestBeaconCommitteeFromState_UpdateCacheForPreviousEpoch:\nvar beaconCommittee []types.ValidatorIndex\nbeaconCommittee, err = BeaconCommitteeFromState(context.Background(), state, 1 /_previous

While PoS developers usually have a proponent for equitable participation in a decentralized manner, most projects end up proposing some level of centralized operation, where the number of validators with full participation rights is limited. These validators are often seen to be the most wealthy, and, as a result, influence the PoS network as they are the most staked. Usually, the number of candidates to maintain the network with the necessary knowledge (and equipment) is limited; this can directly increase operational costs as well. Systems with a large number of validators tend to form pools to decrease the variance of their revenue and profit from economies of scale. These pools are often off-chain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A way to alleviate this is to implement pool formation on-chain and allow token holders to vote with their stake for validators to represent them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Polkadot uses NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake) as its mechanism for selecting the validator set. It is designed with the roles of <strong>validators</strong> and <strong>nominators</strong>, to maximize chain security.

While PoS developers usually have a proponent for equitable participation in a decentralized manner, most projects end up proposing some level of centralized operation, where the number of validators with full participation rights is limited. These validators are often seen to be the most wealthy, and, as a result, influence the PoS network as they are the most staked. Usually, the number of candidates to maintain the network with the necessary knowledge (and equipment) is limited; this can directly increase operational costs as well. Systems with a large number of validators tend to form pools to decrease the variance of their revenue and profit from economies of scale. These pools are often off-chain.\n\n\nA way to alleviate this is to implement pool formation on-chain and allow token holders to vote with their stake for validators to represent them.\n\n\nPolkadot uses NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake) as its mechanism for selecting the validator set. It is designed with the roles of validators and nominators, to maximize chain security. Actors who are interested in maintaining the network can run a validator node.\n\n\nValidators assume the role of producing new blocks in BABE, validating parachain blocks, and guaranteeing finality. Nominators can choose to back select validators with their stake. Nominators can approve candidates that they trust and back them with their tokens.\n\n","title":"Consensus Mechanism","titles":["Polkadot"]},"149":{"href":"/research/chains/polkadot#references","html":"\n<strong>Consensus</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus\">NPoS</a>: Polkadot Nominated Proof of Stake Documentation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus\">Polkadot Consensus</a>: Polkadot&#x27;s documentation on consenus.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://slides.com/paritytech/paritysubstrate#/17\">Hybrid Consensus Slide</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/883\">Generalized Consensus Pull Request</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/core/consensus\">Consensus Code</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/rhododendron\">Rhododendron -

And in this context, &quot;Ethereum&quot; refers not just to the base chain, but also any proper L2 that is built on it. If Ethereum gets 51% attacked and reverts, Arbitrum and Optimism revert too, and so &quot;cross-rollup&quot; applications that hold state on Arbitrum and Optimism are guaranteed to remain consistent even if Ethereum gets 51% attacked. And if Ethereum does not get 51% attacked, there&#x27;s no way to 51% attack Arbitrum and Optimism separately. Hence, holding assets issued on Optimism wrapped on Arbitrum is still perfectly safe.</p>\n<p>Why a rollup can&#x27;t just &quot;go use another data layer&quot;. If a rollup stores its data on Celestia or BCH or whatever else but deals with assets on Ethereum, if that layer gets 51% attacked you&#x27;re screwed. The DAS on Celestia providing 51% attack resistance doesn&#x27;t actually help you because the Ethereum network isn&#x27;t reading that DAS; it would be reading a bridge, which would be vulnerable to 51% attacks.

Note that hash_tree_root and serialize are the same as those defined in sync-gossip.\n\n\n\n\nTODO: Review of Retrieving a transaction proof not just retrieving data on-demand\n\n\n","title":"Transaction Proofs","titles":["Ethereum Near Bridging","Ethereum 2.0 Light Client Support","Light Client Specification"]},"328":{"href":"/research/code/ethereum-near#references","html":"\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Ethereum 2.0 Specifications</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/master/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.mdx\">Beacon Chain Specification</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/extended_light_client_protocol\">Extended light client protocol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/light-client.mdx\">Altair Light Client -- Light Client</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/altair/light-client/sync-protocol.mdx\">Altair Light Client -- Sync Protocol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.mdx\">Beacon Chain Fork Choice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs\">The Portal Network Specification</a>: an in progess effort to enable lightweight protocol access by resource constrained devices.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/les.mdx\">Light Ethereum Subprotocol (LES)</a>: the protocol used by &quot;light&quot; clients, which only download block headers as they appear and fetch other parts of the blockchain on-demand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blockdaemon.com/blog/ethereum-altair-hard-folk-light-clients-sync-committees/\">BlockDaemon: Ethereum Altair Hard Folk: Light Clients &amp; Sync Committees</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oc_zdywOsHxz3zez1ILAgrerS7RkaF1hHoW0FLtp0Gw/edit#slide=id.p\">Efficient algorithms for CBC Casper</a>: Review of LMD GHOST (Latest Message Driven, Greediest Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/ssz/\">SSZ: Simple Serialize</a>: Overview of Simple serialize (SSZ) is the serialization method used on the Beacon Chain.

The block fetch period is configurable in the relayer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The RPC returns the LightClientBlock for the block as far into the future from the last known hash as possible for the light client to still accept it. Specifically, it either returns the last final block of the next epoch, or the last final known block. If there&#x27;s no newer final block than the one the light client knows about, the RPC returns an empty result.</p>\n<p>A standalone light client would bootstrap by requesting next blocks until it receives an empty result, and then periodically request the next light client block.</p>\n<p>A smart contract-based light client that enables a bridge to NEAR on a different blockchain naturally cannot request blocks itself. Instead external oracles query the next light client block from one of the full nodes, and submit it to the light client smart contract.

Proof is the extracted information from the event on Ethereum side.\nBridgeTokenFactory.deposit function will call EthProver and verify that proof is correct and relies on a block with sufficient number of confirmations.\nEthProver will return callback to BridgeTokenFactory confirming that proof is correct.\nBridgeTokenFactory will call &lt;&lt;hex(erc20)&gt;.&lt;bridge_token_factory&gt;&gt;.mint(&lt;near_account_id&gt;, &lt;amount&gt;).\nUser can use &lt;&lt;hex(erc20)&gt;.&lt;bridge_token_factory&gt;&gt; token in other applications now on NEAR.\n\nUsage flow NEAR -&gt; Ethereum\n\ntoken-locker locks NEP141 tokens on NEAR side.\n\nTo deposit funds into the locker, call ft_transfer_call where msg contains Ethereum address the funds should arrive to.\nThis will emit &lt;token: String, amount: u128, recipient address: EthAddress&gt; (which arrives to deposit on Ethereum side).\nAccepts Unlock(token: String, sender_id: EthAddress, amount: u256, recipient: String) event from Ethereum side with a proof, verifies its correctness.\nIf recipient contains &#x27;:&#x27; will split it into &lt;recipient, msg&gt; and do ft_transfer_call(recipient, amount, None, msg). Otherwise will ft_transfer to recipient.\nTo get metadata of token to Ethereum, need to call log_metadata, which will create a result &lt;token: String, name: String, symbol: String, decimals: u8, blockHeight: u64&gt;.\n\nerc20-bridge-token - BridgeTokenFactory and BridgeToken Ethereum contracts.\n\nBridgeTokenFactory creates new BridgeToken that correspond to specific token account id on NEAR side.\nBridgeTokenFactory receives deposit with proof from NEAR, verify them and mint appropriate amounts on recipient addresses.\nCalling withdraw will burn tokens of this user and will generate event &lt;token: String, sender_id: EthAddress, amount: u256, recipient: String&gt; that can be relayed to token-factory.\nCaveats\nGenerally, this connector allows any account to call ft_transfer_call opening for potential malicious tokens to be bridged to Ethereum.\nThe expectation here is that on Ethereum side, the token lists will handle this, as it&#x27;s the same attack model as malicious tokens on Uniswap and other DEXs.\nUsing Ethereum BridgeTokenFactory contract can always resolve Ethereum address of a contract back to NEAR one to check that it is indeed bridging token from NEAR and is created by this factory.\nTesting\nTesting Ethereum side\ncd erc20-connector\nyarn\nyarn run test\nTesting NEAR side\nmake res/bridge_token_factory.wasm\ncargo test --all\n","title":"Token Transfer Process Flow","titles":["Ethereum Near Bridging","Ethereum 2.0 Light Client Support"]},"342":{"href":"/research/code/ethereum-near#token-transfer-components","html":"\n<p><em>Note: This uses Ethreum <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20\">ERC20</a> and NEAR <a href=\"https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/FungibleToken/Core\">NEP-141</a> initally developed for <a href=\"https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/21\">NEP-21</a></em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector\">rainbow-token-connector</a>\n<ul>\n<li>NEAR rust based contracts\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/tree/master/bridge-common\">bridge-common</a>: Common functions for NEAR, currently only <code>pub fn parse_recipient(recipient: String) -&gt; Recipient</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/tree/master/bridge-token-factory\">bridge-token-factory</a>: Functions for managing tokens on NEAR including but not limited to <code>update_metadata</code>, <code>deposit</code>, <code>get_tokens</code>, <code>finish_updating_metadata</code>, <code>finish_updating_metadata</code>, <code>finish_withdraw</code>, <code>deploy_bridge_token</code>, <code>get_bridge_token_account_id</code>, <code>is_used_proof</code>, <code>record_proof</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/tree/master/bridge-token\">bridge-token</a>: Token functions on NEAR including but not limited to <code>mint</code> and <code>withdraw</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/tree/master/token-locker\">token-locker</a>: Token Locker functions on NEAR including but not limited to <code>withdraw</code>, <code>finish_deposit</code>, <code>is_used_proof</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ethereum solidity based contracts\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/tree/master/erc20-bridge-token\">erc20-bridge-token</a>: Ethereum Bridge token contracts including but not limited to\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/blob/master/erc20-bridge-token/contracts/BridgeToken.sol\">BridgeToken.sol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/blob/master/erc20-bridge-token/contracts/BridgeTokenFactory.sol\">BridgeTokenFactory.sol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/blob/master/erc20-bridge-token/contracts/BridgeTokenProxy.sol\">BridgeTokenProxy.sol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/blob/master/erc20-bridge-token/contracts/ProofConsumer.sol\">ProofConsumer.sol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/blob/master/erc20-bridge-token/contracts/ResultsDecoder.sol\">ResultsDecoder</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/tree/master/erc20-connector\">erc20-connector</a>: has <a href=\"https://github.com/aurora-is-near/rainbow-token-connector/blob/master/erc20-connector/contracts/ERC20Locker.sol\">ERC20Locker.sol</a> which is used to lock and unlock tokens.

(6.4 minutes) a validator proposes an attestation to the network. The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The attestation contains the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)</li>\n<li>data: details relating to the attestation, as defined below</li>\n<li>signature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>slot: The slot number that the attestation refers to</li>\n<li>index: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot</li>\n<li>beacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)</li>\n<li>source: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block</li>\n<li>target: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.</p>\n<p>Finally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<strong>Technical Details</strong>\n<p>Following is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations.

The attestation is for a specific slot in the epoch. The purpose of the attestation is to vote in favor of the validator&#x27;s view of the chain, in particular the most recent justified block and the first block in the current epoch (known as source and target checkpoints). This information is combined for all participating validators, enabling the network to reach consensus about the state of the blockchain.\nThe attestation contains the following components:\n\naggregation_bits: a bitlist of validators where the position maps to the validator index in their committee; the value (0/1) indicates whether the validator signed the data (i.e. whether they are active and agree with the block proposer)\ndata: details relating to the attestation, as defined below\nsignature: a BLS signature that aggregates the signatures of individual validators\n\nThe first task for an attesting validator is to build the data. The data contains the following information:\n\nslot: The slot number that the attestation refers to\nindex: A number that identifies which committee the validator belongs to in a given slot\nbeacon_block_root: Root hash of the block the validator sees at the head of the chain (the result of applying the fork-choice algorithm)\nsource: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the most recent justified block\ntarget: Part of the finality vote indicating what the validators see as the first block in the current epoch\n\nOnce the data is built, the validator can flip the bit in aggregation_bits corresponding to their own validator index from 0 to 1 to show that they participated.\nFinally, the validator signs the attestation and broadcasts it to the network.\n\nTechnical Details\nFollowing is an overview of the state structure and logic for generating committees and aggregating attestations. For data structures, please see Beacon State Data Structures from Prysm and web3signer_types from prysm.\nBeaconState contains both a ReadOnlyBeaconState and a WriteOnlyBeaconState wich contain ReadOnlyValidators and ReadOnlyRandaoMixes and WriteOnlyValidators and WriteOnlyRandaoMixes respectively.\nAt the beginning of each epoch func ProcessRandaoMixesReset processes the final updates to RANDAO mix during epoch processing. This calls RandaoMix which returns the randao mix (xor&#x27;ed seed) of a given slot. It is used to shuffle validators.\nFollowing are sample mixes generated from func TestRandaoMix_OK by adding the statement fmt.Printf(&quot;mix: %v\\n&quot;, mix)\nmix: [10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [40 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nmix: [159 134 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nThe shuffle functions consist of\n\n\nfunc ShuffleList: returns list of shuffled indexes in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\nFollowing is an example of a shuffled list generated from TestShuffleList_OK\nlist1: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\nseed1: [1 128 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\nshuffledList1: [0 7 8 6 3 9 4 5 2 1]\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndex: returns p(index) in a pseudorandom permutation p of 0...list_size - 1 with “seed“ as entropy. We utilize &#x27;swap or not&#x27; shuffling in this implementation; we are allocating the memory with the seed that stays constant between iterations instead of reallocating it each iteration as in the spec. This implementation is based on the original implementation from protolambda, https://github.com/protolambda/eth2-shuffle\n\n\nfunc ShuffleIndices: ShuffledIndices uses input beacon state and returns the shuffled indices of the input epoch, the shuffled indices then can be used to break up into committees.\n\n\nCommittes are formed using functions from beacon_comittee.go\n\n\nfunc BeaconComittee: returns the beacon committee of a given slot and committee index. The validator indices and seed are provided as an argument rather than an imported implementation from the spec definition. Having them as an argument allows for cheaper computation run time. (This is an optomized version of func BeaconComitteFromState)\nFollowing is an example of a beaconComittee generated by adding the following lines to TestBeaconCommitteeFromState_UpdateCacheForPreviousEpoch:\n\n\nvar beaconCommittee []types.ValidatorIndex\nbeaconCommittee, err = BeaconCommitteeFromState(context.Background(), state, 1 /_previous

The bootstrap object is passed to initialize_light_client_store to obtain a local LightClientStore.\nThe light client tracks the sync committee periods finalized_period from store.finalized_header.slot, optimistic_period from store.optimistic_header.slot, and current_period from current_slot based on the local clock.\n\nWhen finalized_period == optimistic_period and is_next_sync_committee_known indicates False, the light client fetches a LightClientUpdate for finalized_period. If finalized_period == current_period, this fetch SHOULD be scheduled at a random time before current_period advances.\nWhen finalized_period + 1 &lt; current_period, the light client fetches a LightClientUpdate for each sync committee period in range [finalized_period + 1, current_period) (current period excluded)\nWhen finalized_period + 1 &gt;= current_period, the light client keeps observing LightClientFinalityUpdate and LightClientOptimisticUpdate. Received objects are passed to process_light_client_finality_update and process_light_client_optimistic_update. This ensures that finalized_header and optimistic_header reflect the latest blocks.\n\n\nprocess_light_client_store_force_update MAY be called based on use case dependent heuristics if light client sync appears stuck.

To do that, the verification logic is often encapsulated inside a light client, manifested as a smart contract on the chain which the verification needs to be executed. The light client needs to follow consensus and signature verification mechanisms based on the signing algorithm and the elliptical curve used on the other side. For example, if chain A has 21 validators signing each block using ECDSA algorithm on secp256k1 curves, then chain A&#x27;s light client, executed on chain B, must extract the signatures from the block headers presented to the light client, and follow the ECDSA signature verification algorithm to verify the content of the block header indeeds produces the 21 signatures contained in the block header, given the public keys of the 21 validators.</p>\n<p>Here, we present a reference table for these signature schemes and how they are used in the consensus protocols of different blockchains. We limit our initial scope to Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, Harmony, Cosmos, and Polkadot only (and their undelying technologies).

For example, if chain A has 21 validators signing each block using ECDSA algorithm on secp256k1 curves, then chain A&#x27;s light client, executed on chain B, must extract the signatures from the block headers presented to the light client, and follow the ECDSA signature verification algorithm to verify the content of the block header indeeds produces the 21 signatures contained in the block header, given the public keys of the 21 validators.\nHere, we present a reference table for these signature schemes and how they are used in the consensus protocols of different blockchains. We limit our initial scope to Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, Harmony, Cosmos, and Polkadot only (and their undelying technologies). Note that we are only looking at how signatures are used in consensus, not elsewhere in the blockchain stack, as all these protocols use ECDSA on secp256k1 for accounts in EVM interactions.\nAlgorithmCurveProtocolCodeNoteECDSAsecp256k1PolygonlibModified Tendermint validator signature schemeBSClib usageDerived from Clique, then improvedBLSBN254EthereumEVMAdded by EIP-196,197; Mainly for use in smart contracts, such as zk-snark verification.
