### IntentSwap Flow

1. Swapper(via CompactX) calls Quoter (Callibrator, SmartOrderRouter)
2. Quoter returns Output Tokens for Swap
3. Swapper Agrees on Swap and
   a. Calls Disseminator which stores all Compact Information and Creates IntentSwapHash
   b. calls Intent Manager to create SwapIntent (more callData and would use EventData to publish to Solvers)
4. Intent Manager(Sponsor) formats Compact, Mandate data and Signature
5. IntentManager(Sponsor) calls Allocator to create a compact
6. Allocator creates a compact locking the funds
7. Allocator creates a claim emitting an event that can be processed by Solvers
8. Solver determines the optimal route (using Tycho Simulation)
9. Solver creates a SolverPayload containing the callData for the Transactions to be executed
10. Solver calls the Arbiter to Execute the Payload and Unlock the Funds
11. Arbiter receives the IntentSwapSolve
12. Aribiter request approval to use the IntentSwaps InputTokens for the-compact via the Allocator
13. Arbiter executes the Solve on behalf of the Solver
    a. using the SolverPayload
    b. Executing via the dispatcher
    c. Using the allocated input tokens
14. Arbiter then checks if the Amount of Output Tokens satisfies the mandate
15. If the Output Tokens are less than the mandate then reverts STOP
16. Arbiter sends a signed message to the Allocator to close the compact
    a. Any unused input tokens are returned to the Sponsor.
    b. Output Tokens are returned to the Solver
