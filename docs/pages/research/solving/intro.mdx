## Overview

Here you'll find my work in 2025 on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). As of July 2025 I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes.

## Abstract

Liquidity Fragmentation and Capital Efficiency are areas that can be optimized in Blockchain protocols, with the emergence of Multiple L2 Chains and a shift towards intent-based architectures. There is a greater need than ever for a settlement layer to balance provided liquidity.

Project Description: Jincubator (Working Name) provides infrastructure and services for multi-chain, intent-based protocols, leveraging hooks built on Uniswap V4.

It aims to provide the following

**Features of the Solution**

- Pool Functionality
  - JIT Liquidity Provisioning,
  - Dynamic Fees to reduce arbitrage,
  - Gas Manager allows users to pay for gas using their swap token instead of the native token,
  - Incentivization Tools for Pools to incentivize Liquidity Providers,
- Order Flow
  - Intent Solving infrastructure providing traders with the best value for their swap,
  - SlowTrack and Fastrak - Settlement Options,
- Capital Efficiency
  - Settlement Layer with Dynamic Rebalancing of Capital Across Chains,
  - JIT provisioning of liquidity to pools as needed which integrates with Yield Earning Protocols.,
  - Arbitraging Liquidity across Pools, Protocols, and Chains

**Solution we are implementing**

- Intent Based - Cross Chain Solving
- Dynamic Cross-Chain Capital Allocation for Liquidity Providers
- JIT Liquidity Provisioning for Pools
- Yield Earning Capabilities for unitilized liquidity
- Centralized Liquidity Pool which is dynamically allocated
- Settlement Layer used by Solvers and Liquidity Providers used to rebalance funds across chains.
- Advanced Indexing and Simulation capabilities to enable a global view of liquidity, swap prices and arbitrage opportunities
