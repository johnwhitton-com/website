# Solving and Arbitrage Research

## Overview

Work in 2025 on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). As of July 2025 I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes.

## Abstract

Liquidity Fragmentation and Capital Efficiency are areas that can be optimized in Blockchain protocols, with the emergence of Multiple L2 Chains and a shift towards intent-based architectures. There is a greater need than ever for a settlement layer to balance provided liquidity.

This is an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and multichain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution.
