## Overview

Polymer’s[^ov-1] modular IBC[^ov-2] design allows for chains, like Ethereum[^ov-3], to easily integrate IBC transport and become interoperable across all ecosystems in a decentralized manner.

Our protocol combines a novel consensus engine[^ov-4], zero knowledge technology[^ov-5], and modular IBC[^ov-6] to create the most efficient and scalable IBC routing solution.
Polymer is the first chain dedicated to the routing of IBC packets.
