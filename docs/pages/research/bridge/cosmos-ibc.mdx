# Cosmos IBC

## Overview

Cosmos is a network of the many blockchains built on IBC protocol. The IBC protocol is a universal interoperability protocol that allows two different blockchains to communicate with one another. IBC guarantees reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication. See [Cosmos Network Whitepaper](https://v1.cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper)

Blockchains based on IBC protocol may use validity based proofs for interchain communication. See [IBC Protocol ELI5: What is IBC?](https://medium.com/the-interchain-foundation/eli5-what-is-ibc-def44d7b5b4c)

### Protocol

- [Design](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc): the primary repository for development and documentation
- [Docs](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/3-ibc/): a quick introduction. See also [ibc-go documentation](https://ibc.cosmos.network/)
- [Implementation](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go): Implementation in Golang, built as a Cosmos SDK module.
- [Roadmap](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/roadmap/roadmap.html)

### Bridging

- [Relayer](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer): "...blockchains do not directly pass messages to each other over the network. This is where relayer comes in. A relayer process monitors for updates on opens paths between sets of IBC enabled chains..."
- [Light Clients](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main/ibc/light-clients/overview.html): "...Light clients operate under a strict set of rules which provide security guarantees for state updates and facilitate the ability to verify the state of a remote blockchain using merkle proofs"

### Utilities

- [Explorer](https://hub.mintscan.io/chains/ibc-network): Monitoring interchain activities and messaging in 3D
- [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/): Wallet designed to work across blockchains on IBC (see [Getting Started with Cosmos IBC Transfers](https://catdotfish.medium.com/getting-started-with-ibc-transfers-276e9ce91e17))
