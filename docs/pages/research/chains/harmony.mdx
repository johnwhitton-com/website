## Overview

Despite relatively lower usage than other candidates, Harmony has a mature, battle-tested implementation for fast consensus using BLS-based signature schemes, which has been in production for over 2 years. Additionally, many other chains are also moving towards using BLS for signing blocks in their consensus protocols.

Harmony follows a two-round Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus derived from PBFT, where BLS signatures (on the BLS12-381 curve) are used to reduce communication costs[^1]. Blocks are produced by validator leaders, a minimal subset of validators, then further broadcasted to all validators and confirmed when more than 2/3 of validators sign the block with their own BLS signatures. The leader then aggregates the signatures into a single one and broadcasts again. The validators may verify the aggregated signature and sign the block again before sending the signed block back to the leader. Finally, the leader (after receiving signatures from 2/3 of the validators) may aggregate the signature for one last time and finalize the block. In the block header, the leader records which validators' signatures are received in each round.

The protocol uses a slot-bidding mechanism to elect a variable number of validators to fill 800-slots, where each validator may occupy multiple slots if their total delegated stake per slot is greater than the effective median[^2].

## Consensus Mechanism

### Harmony Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT)

The following is an excerpt from [Consensus](https://docs.harmony.one/home/general/technology/consensus)

> The consensus algorithm is a key component of any blockchain. It determines the security and performance of a blockchain and is often referred to as the "engine" of a blockchain. Harmony’s consensus algorithm is called Fast Byzantine Fault Tolerance (FBFT), which is an innovative upgrade on the famous PBFT algorithm. FBFT is one order of magnitude faster and more scalable than PBFT because BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) aggregate signature is used to significantly reduce the communication cost. Specifically, FBFT allows at least 250 validators to reach consensus within 2 seconds.
>
> For every round of consensus in FBFT, one validator serves as the “leader” and there are three phases: the announce phase, the prepare phase and the commit phase. In the announce phase, the leader proposes a new block and broadcasts the block hash to all of the validators. In the prepare phase, validators verify the message and sign on the block hash, as well as sending the signature back to the leader. The prepare phase finishes when signatures with more than 2/3 of the voting power are collected. After that, the leader aggregated the collected signatures into a O(1)-sized BLS aggregate signature and then broadcast it with the whole block to start the commit phase. The commit phase involves validators verifying the block and doing a similar signing process as the prepare phase (i.e. 2/3 voting power collection). The consensus is reached after the commit phase is done. This whole process can be done within 2 seconds in mainnet.

The following is an excerpt from [Epoch Transition](https://docs.harmony.one/home/network/validators/definitions/epoch-transition)

> An epoch is a period of time when the beacon shard (i.e. shard 0, the coordinator for other shards) produces a fixed number of blocks. In Harmony mainnet, an epoch is 32768 blocks (~18.2h with a 2s block time) in the beacon shard

_Note: If the leader fails to produce a block within a certain time frame, then a new leader is elected_

## Signing Mechanism

Harmony uses BLS12_381 signatures for validators signing blocks. They began work on enhancing the [herumi/bls package](https://github.com/herumi/bls) in Jan 2019 to [support BLS12_381](https://github.com/harmony-one/bls/commit/302fc1eea9d59cecb1a464280944f5b152d7e781). They have added [bls](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/blob/main/crypto/bls/bls.go) and [mutibls](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/blob/main/multibls/multibls.go) to the [harmony codbase](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony) leveraging their [harmony-one bls package](https://github.com/harmony-one/bls).

## Light Client Support

Harmony is actively looking at light client support[^3].

Some initial work has been done for the support of [Merkle Mountain Ranges](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.mdx) has been proposed by Harmony in the pull request [[WIP] MMR-HardFork: add go-merklemountainrange and modified merkle proof logic #3872](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/pull/3872).

This introduces a new field into the block header populated by [mmr.go](https://github.com/gupadhyaya/harmony/blob/mmr-hard-fork/internal/mmr/mmr.go) which credits [zmitton/go-merklemountainrange](https://github.com/zmitton/go-merklemountainrange).

Updated [Interface.go](https://github.com/gupadhyaya/harmony/blob/mmr-hard-fork/block/interface/header.go)

```
// MMRRoot is the root of the Merkle Mountain Range tree formed
// using the block hashes of the current epoch
MMRRoot() []byte

// SetMMRRoot sets the updated MMR root after appending the parentHash
SetMMRRoot(newMMRRoot []byte)
```

Updated [header.go](https://github.com/gupadhyaya/harmony/blob/mmr-hard-fork/block/v4/header.go)

```
// MMRRoot is the root of the Merkle Mountain Range tree formed
// using the block hashes of the current epoch
func (h *Header) MMRRoot() []byte {
 return append(h.fields.MMRRoot[:0:0], h.fields.MMRRoot...)
}

// SetMMRRoot sets the updated MMR root after appending the parentHash
func (h *Header) SetMMRRoot(newMMRRoot []byte) {
 h.fields.MMRRoot = append(newMMRRoot[:0:0], newMMRRoot...)
}
```

Harmony [MMR PR Review](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/pull/3872) and [latest PR](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/pull/4198/files) uses Merkle Mountain Ranges to facilitate light client development against Harmony's sharded Proof of Stake Chain.

**Sample Light Client Implementation: Horizon Bridge Harmony Light Client Deployed on Ethereum**

This enables the validation of previous blocks by implemented by [TokenLockerOnEthereum.sol](https://github.com/johnwhitton/horizon/blob/refactorV2/contracts/TokenLockerOnEthereum.sol) to use [MMRVerifier.sol](https://github.com/johnwhitton/horizon/blob/refactorV2/contracts/lib/MMRVerifier.sol) uses `./lib/MMRVerifier.sol` to validate the [Mountain Merkle Ranges](https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.mdx)

## Code Review

The [Harmony codebase](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony) was originally cloned from [Ethereum 1.0](./ethereum-1-0.mdx) around 2019.Thus the majority of code incuding primitives, signing are similar as at that period. Since then Ethreum has worked siginficantly on Ethreum 2.0 and these modifications were selectively leveraged by Harmony.

[Harmony has significant differences](https://medium.com/harmony-one/2022-harmony-technical-review-88462efba368) from Ethereum 1.0 including sharding, Effective Proof of Stake Consensus Mechanism, [Rosetta support](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html) and verifiable delay functions and verifiaable random functions.
