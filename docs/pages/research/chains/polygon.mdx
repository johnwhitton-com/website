# Polygon

## Overview

Polygon is representative because it uses ECDSA on secp256k1 and a relatively fixed validator set.

The consensus protocol is based on Peppermint<sup>[8](#f8)</sup>, a modified version of Tendermint. Validators sign produced blocks using the ECDSA signature scheme on secp256k1 curves<sup>[9](#f9)</sup>. Currently, the validator set size is fixed at 100 and only changes when a current validator resigns. This restriction will change when a new auction mechanism is implemented.<sup>[10](#f10)</sup>

## Consensus Mechanism

Polygon uses Peppermint (a modified version of tendermint) Consensus.

Following is an excerpt from [Polygon Architecture](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic-docs/blob/master/docs/pos/polygon-architecture.mdx).

**Polygon Architecture**

> Heimdall is the proof of stake validation layer that handles the aggregation of blocks produced by Bor into a Merkle tree and publishes the Merkle root periodically to the root chain. The periodic publishing of snapshots of the Bor sidechain is called checkpoints.
>
> 1. Validates all the blocks since the last checkpoint.
> 2. Creates a Merkle tree of the block hashes.
> 3. Publishes the Merkle root hash to the Ethereum mainnet.
>
> Checkpoints are important for two reasons:
>
> 1. Providing finality on the root chain.
> 2. Providing proof of burn in withdrawal of assets.
>
> An overview of the process:
>
> - A subset of active validators from the pool is selected to act as block producers for a span. These block producers are responsible for creating blocks and broadcasting the created blocks on the network.
> - A checkpoint includes the Merkle root hash of all blocks created during any given interval. All nodes validate the Merkle root hash and attach their signature to it.
> - A selected proposer from the validator set is responsible for collecting all signatures for a particular checkpoint and committing the checkpoint on the Ethereum mainnet.
> - The responsibility of creating blocks and proposing checkpoints is variably dependent on a validator’s stake ratio in the overall pool.
>
> More details on Heimdall are available on the Heimdall architecture guide.

## Signing Mechanism

Following is an excerpt from and [Peppermint.md](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic-docs/blob/master/docs/pos/peppermint.mdx).

> Peppermint is a modified Tendermint. It is changed to make it compatible with Ethereum addresses and verifiable on Ethereum chain.
>
> Overview
>
> 1. Changes to signature scheme
> 2. Changes to `vote` to make it verifiable on Ethereum smart contract
> 3. Changes to `vote` encoding scheme
>
> Peppermint uses `secp256k1` signature scheme to verify Tendermint votes on solidity smart contract.

>
> It adds `Data` field into `Vote` and `Proposal` struct to get `hash` for transactions in the block. On smart contract, it checks if `Data` matches with checkpoint data hash and majority (⅔+1) of validator signatures. The idea is to verify if majority of the validator set agrees on transaction in the contract.
>
> Peppermint uses RLP to get `Vote` bytes instead of Amino encoding. Here `Data` is `Txs.Hash()` for the block.

> // [peppermint] create RLP vote to decode in contract
> type CanonicalRLPVote struct {
>  ChainID string
>  Type    byte
>  Height  uint
>  Round   uint
>  Data    []byte
> }
> ```
>
> And using RLP encoding lib to get byte data for signature on Vote.

> ```go
> func (vote *Vote) SignBytes(chainID string) []byte {
>  // [peppermint] converted from amino to rlp
>  bz, err := rlp.EncodeToBytes(CanonicalizeVote(chainID, vote))
>  if err != nil {
>   panic(err)

**Note: As of March 12th, 2023 the pepperming votes function now uses amino**

[tendermint/types/vote.go](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/types/vote.go)

```go
func (vote *Vote) SignBytes(chainID string) []byte {
 // [peppermint] converted from amino to rlp
 bz, err := cdc.MarshalBinaryLengthPrefixed(CanonicalizeVote(chainID, vote))
 if err != nil {
  panic(err)
 }
 return bz
}
```

[tendermint/consensus/codec.go](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/consensus/codec.go)

```go
package consensus

import (
 amino "github.com/tendermint/go-amino"
 "github.com/tendermint/tendermint/types"
)

var cdc = amino.NewCodec()

func init() {
 RegisterConsensusMessages(cdc)
 RegisterWALMessages(cdc)
 types.RegisterBlockAmino(cdc)
}

```

[tendermint/p2p/codec.go](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/p2p/codec.go)

```go
package p2p

import (
 amino "github.com/tendermint/go-amino"
 cryptoAmino "github.com/tendermint/tendermint/crypto/encoding/amino"
)

var cdc = amino.NewCodec()

func init() {
 cryptoAmino.RegisterAmino(cdc)
}
```

## Code Review

Polygon's [peppermint fork of tendermint](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint) was forked from [tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) and as such the codebase has similar functions to those documented in [cosmos code review](./cosmos#code-review).

The major changes are to the consensus and signing (see above)

Polygon's [bor](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor) is cloned from [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and as such the codebase has similar functions to those documented in [ethereum 1-0 code review](./ethereum-1-0#code-review).

The returned signature will be of the form R `||` S (in lower-S form)._

### Consensus
