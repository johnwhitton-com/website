</div>

This knowledge base and learning center is based upon research I have done around bridging, zero knowledge and chain consensus and signing up until 2023. For more recent work I have been doing at [ECO](https://eco.com) please read the [docs](https://docs.eco.com/) and the codebase for [cross-L2-transactions](https://github.com/ecoinc/Cross-L2-Actions).

**Specifically I'd like to thank**

- [eco](https://eco.com): Where I was fortunate enough to lead the engineering team and work on hard problems around Cross L2 Transactions and designing and bulding a dedicated rollup.
- [Aaron Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronqli/): who has mentored and driven much of the research around cryptographic primitives, wallets, gaming and trustless bridging.
- [The Delendum Team](https://delendum.xyz/team): who are leading many zero knowledge research initiatives.
- [Ganesha Upadhyaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gupadhyaya/): For his leading work on the horizon bridge and other trustless bridging research.
- [Rongjian Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rongjianlan/): For his work on core protocol, specifically Harmony and the knowledge which he generously shared.
