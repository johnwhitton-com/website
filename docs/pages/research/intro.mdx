This knowledge base and learning center is based upon research I have done around bridging, zero knowledge and chain consensus and signing up until 2023.

**Specifically I'd like to thank**

- [Propellor Heads](https://www.propellerheads.xyz/): For their outstanding work on indexing, simulation and execution for Solvers as part of [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview) which lays the foundation for the jincubator platform.
- [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview): For their leading work on [Uniswap V4 Hook Architecture](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/hooks) and their inspirational design of [CompactX](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) including resource locking via [the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact) and attestations via [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signing implemented in [Tribunal](https://github.com/uniswap/tribunal).
- [Atrium Academy](https://atrium.academy/uniswap): For their Uniswap V4 Hook Incubator and the mentors Haardik and Saucepoint.
- [eco](https://eco.com): Where I was fortunate enough to lead the engineering team and work on hard problems around Cross L2 Transactions and designing and bulding a dedicated rollup.
- [Aaron Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronqli/): who has mentored and driven much of the research around cryptographic primitives, wallets, gaming and trustless bridging.
- [The Delendum Team](https://delendum.xyz/team): who are leading many zero knowledge research initiatives.
- [Ganesha Upadhyaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gupadhyaya/): For his leading work on the horizon bridge and other trustless bridging research.
- [Rongjian Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rongjianlan/): For his work on core protocol, specifically Harmony and the knowledge which he generously shared.

## 2025 Research

Below is a quick overview of an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and multichain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution.

For more details please see

- [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for my work on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview).
- [uhi5-exercises](https://github.com/johnwhitton/uhi5-exercises) for Uniswap V4 Hook examples built as part of [UHI5 Atrium Academy](https://atrium.academy/uniswap).
