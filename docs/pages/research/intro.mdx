This knowledge base and learning center is based upon research I have done around bridging, zero knowledge and chain consensus and signing up until 2023.

For more recent work I have been doing please see

- [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for my work on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview).
- [uhi5-exercises](https://github.com/johnwhitton/uhi5-exercises) for Uniswap V4 Hook examples built as part of [UHI5 Atrium Academy](https://atrium.academy/uniswap).
- [eco-routes](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes/tree/ED-4357) for earlier work on cross-chain intents done at [ECO](https://eco.com/docs/what-is-eco) including [eco-routes](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes/tree/ED-4357) and this branch is where I worked on [proving](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes/blob/ED-4357/contracts/Prover.sol) and designing [cross-chain batch settlement](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes/blob/ED-4357/scripts/testnet/batchSettleGeneral.ts)

**Specifically I'd like to thank**

- [Propellor Heads](https://www.propellerheads.xyz/): For their outstanding work on indexing, simulation and execution for Solvers as part of [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview) which lays the foundation for the jincubator platform.
- [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview): For their leading work on [Uniswap V4 Hook Architecture](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/hooks) and their inspirational design of [CompactX](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) including resource locking via [the-compact](https://github.com/uniswap/the-compact) and attestations via [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signing implemented in [Tribunal](https://github.com/uniswap/tribunal).
- [Atrium Academy](https://atrium.academy/uniswap): For their Uniswap V4 Hook Incubator and the mentors Haardik and Saucepoint.
- [eco](https://eco.com): Where I was fortunate enough to lead the engineering team and work on hard problems around Cross L2 Transactions and designing and bulding a dedicated rollup.
- [Aaron Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronqli/): who has mentored and driven much of the research around cryptographic primitives, wallets, gaming and trustless bridging.
- [The Delendum Team](https://delendum.xyz/team): who are leading many zero knowledge research initiatives.
- [Ganesha Upadhyaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gupadhyaya/): For his leading work on the horizon bridge and other trustless bridging research.
- [Rongjian Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rongjianlan/): For his work on core protocol, specifically Harmony and the knowledge which he generously shared.
