Hello, I'm John, and I'm a Research/engineer, technical leader, and entrepreneur working at the intersection of blockchain infrastructure (Solving, Market Making, Arbitrage) and Decentralized protocols (Intents, Liquidity Management, Settlement). I have a track record of driving projects from conception to completion, identifying research gaps, and providing solutions. Finally, I love leading engineering teams and have the ability to drive collaboration across the organization and the entire ecosystem.

I build high-performance solving and market-making infrastructure and DeFi protocols (Intents, Liquidity Management, Settlement), including

- Solver: Advanced Liquidity Mapping and Route Evaluation supporting multiple strategies for solving and market making.
  - Built on Tycho with its own liquidity mapping layer, able to evaluate over 1000 routes per second
- Solving Integration: UniswapX, 1inch, and CowSwap
- DeFi: UniswapV4 Hooks, NoLiquidity Solving, IntentSwapHook
- Liquidity Management: ERC-6909 Resource Management built on the compact

I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes.

Below is a quick professional summary, more detail can be found on [the resume page](https://johnwhitton.com/resume/intro)

I worked as a Senior Protocol Engineer, previously Engineering Manager at [Eco](https://eco.com) building a payment focused intent protocol on a dedicated L3 rollup. Read the docs [here](https://docs.eco.com/) and the code [here](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes).

I have researched zero knowledge proofs, cryptographic primitives and consensus protocols.

I consulted as a research engineer providing strategy, research, design and building out DeFi infrastructure including trustless bridging, web3 identity and wallets. Deployments have been on EVM compatible chains including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).

I prototyped the DEX [Kanga Finance](https://github.com/kangafinance) (inspired by [Sushi](https://github.com/sushiswap)) and a DeFi parachain [eave.network](https://github.com/eavenetwork) (inspired by [Acala](https://github.com/acalanetwork)). Deployments on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/). As founder for these projects, I was responsible for writing whitepapers, reviewing legal infrastructure, and fundraising. Although projects had investor interest and were awarded [hackathon prizes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZGrbKSaAdtzvMzVh0EVFBfUvA4SqiAeYVXGhJN7Orbs/edit#slide=id.g48989ac23a_0_0) the projects did not move forward due to a combination of team commitment, market fit and crypto market conditions.

Previously I was as an Ecosystem Architect at Harmony. Where I helped launch the Harmony Mainnet, grew the ecosystem and was also intimately involved with hiring decisions and business strategy. Prior to this I was CTO for Loyyal (BaaS company) where we built private permissioned blockchains on Ethereum and Hypersphere Fabric and I managed a team of seven engineers.

I have worked extensively with decentralized financial protocols, bringing a unique perspective by combining my extensive corporate experience with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and KPMG with the disruptive financial models being developed on blockchain.

My earlier career focused on enterprise applications, service oriented architectures and cross application business processes. Where I founded a consultancy firm which grew to $800k in revenues and ran from 2000-2009. One of my former clients, EFI ($1.6 billion market cap) brought me on as a Manager in Enterprise Systems Architecture where I remained for 6 years.

I have been passionate about software and technology since high school. I graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science before travelling globally leading the design and development of many Service Oriented Architectures and Blockchain implementations.
