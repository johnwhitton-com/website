![John Whitton Work History](/images/JohnWhittonWorkHistory.png "John Whitton Work History")

Hello, I'm currently evaluating new opportunities, and Iâ€™d like to continue working with smart contracts similar to the work which I did on eco-routes but do more work at the protocol/infrastructure level in (go and rust). Also, potentially working on zk-circuits and their integration into cross-chain proving mechanisms are also of interest. I'm happy working as an individual contributor or leading engineering teams, as have done so for a large part of my career.Historically I've worked with Early Stage Startups 10-30 team members but am comfortable with both smaller and larger teams.

I recently worked as a Senior Protocol Engineer, previously Engineering Manager at [Eco](https://eco.com) building a payment focused intent protocol on a dedicated L3 rollup. Read the docs [here](https://docs.eco.com/) and the code [here](https://github.com/eco/eco-routes).

Previous work includes researching zero knowledge proofs, cryptographic primitives and consensus protocols. I also consult as a research engineer providing strategy, research, design and building out DeFi infrastructure including trustless bridging, web3 identity and wallets. Deployments have been on EVM compatible chains including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).

I prototyped the DEX [Kanga Finance](https://github.com/kangafinance) (inspired by [Sushi](https://github.com/sushiswap)) and a DeFi parachain [eave.network](https://github.com/eavenetwork) (inspired by [Acala](https://github.com/acalanetwork)). Deployments on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) and [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/). As founder for these projects, I was responsible for writing whitepapers, reviewing legal infrastructure, and fundraising. Although projects had investor interest and were awarded [hackathon prizes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZGrbKSaAdtzvMzVh0EVFBfUvA4SqiAeYVXGhJN7Orbs/edit#slide=id.g48989ac23a_0_0) the projects did not move forward due to a combination of team commitment, market fit and crypto market conditions.

Previously I was as an Ecosystem Architect at Harmony. Where I helped launch the Harmony Mainnet, grew the ecosystem and was also intimately involved with hiring decisions and business strategy. Prior to this I was CTO for Loyyal (BaaS company) where we built private permissioned blockchains on Ethereum and Hypersphere Fabric and I managed a team of seven engineers.

I have worked extensively with decentralized financial protocols, bringing a unique perspective by combining my extensive corporate experience with IBM, SAP, Deloitte and KPMG with the disruptive financial models being developed on blockchain.

My earlier career focused on enterprise applications, service oriented architectures and cross application business processes. Where I founded a consultancy firm which grew to $800k in revenues and ran from 2000-2009. One of my former clients, EFI ($1.6 billion market cap) brought me on as a Manager in Enterprise Systems Architecture where I remained for 6 years.

I have been passionate about software and technology since high school. I graduated from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science before travelling globally leading the design and development of many Service Oriented Architectures and Blockchain implementations.
