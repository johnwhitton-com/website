I have been fortunate over my long career to have the opportunity to work with some of the most talented individuals and teams not only in Silicon Valley, but globally.

In my role as a founder, cto, ecoystem architect and engineer. I have learned from great leaders,
researchers, business strategists and engineers. I have built great teams and mentored many talented junior engineers. I have watched my teams apply their solid technical foundation to become invaluable contributors to the team and the organization. Watching individuals grow both personally and professionally is the most rewarding work I have done.

Here is a video highlighting the strengths of the Harmony Team that I was fortunate enough to work with.
