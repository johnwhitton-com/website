John is one of the most professional engineers Iâ€™ve ever worked with. He takes the ownership of many OPS works,
and documents them down with meticulous details. Also, he is a fast learner, and eager to pick up new skills. He also has very good project management skills, and I believe he could be a very good leader either in biz or eng departments.
