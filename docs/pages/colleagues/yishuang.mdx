John is a really good team player, among his good qualities, I admire three most. 
1. Helpful and warm-hearted whenever you ask for help, John will give you the best help. 
2. Avid learner, John likes to learn new things and will actively take new tasks. I see John actively in ops recently. 
3. Responsible, longer view, John focused a lot on knowledge transfer. He wants to make sure the knowledge can be shared with the whole team and future new employees, so he contributed a lot on internal wiki gitbooks, which I think itâ€™s a good point.
