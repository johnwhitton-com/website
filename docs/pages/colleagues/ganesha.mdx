John is dedicated, hard-working, great work ethics, and brings lot of positive energy. no doubt that he is a great manager with good people skills. john led the whole hiring process and single handedly managed it well, without much chaos. no joke how much time and energy it takes. great job. while i believe it was not the best use of john's time, he embraced whatever this staking launch demanded from him. great work towards managing the release (deployment, documentation, etc) and taking some load of andy and daniel. after the staking release, john could refocus and quickly get back to speed on the ecosystem/tooling/partner tasks/goals for q4 and expedite some of the deliverables.
