### [Olivier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierveyrac/)

John and I worked together at Autodesk during the implementation of the subscription program, John was a lead SAP developer working on the program. I frequently interacted with him as we rolled out the program. John has the rare gift of being able to understand complex business problems and map them to a technical solution. His drive and passion for the project, combined with his excellent communication skills and deep technical knowledge, were key factors in the successful rollout of the program. We've since become close friends. I'd recommend anyone looking for a technical lead with business acumen to consider John.
